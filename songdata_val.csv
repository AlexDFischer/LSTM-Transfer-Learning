Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows  
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd  
Thinking, wondering what you're doing  
I can't stop myself from crying out loud  
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar  
But then, they never shared our love

How I hate to spend the evening on my own  
Autumn winds  
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room  
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Movie stars  
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win  
It's so different from the world I'm living in  
Tired of T. V.  
I open the window and I gaze into the night  
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays

Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away

And wish that you could stay  
I'd like another day with you  
  
Don't want to know where it ends  
I'll live with either way  
Just tell me what I have to do.  
  
Where is the joy time forgets  
You ask me if I know  
It's still as before  
Up on a breeze soaring high  
It comes alive each day  
Whenever you call  
But now to lose your love  
The charm throughout my day  
To walk along our paths all alone  
  
I have memories enough  
To help me find my way  
To bring back all the love we've known

And if you think you're gonna lose  
Well, you're probably gonna lose  
So what's the point in trying anymore?  
  
What you're looking for, you'll find  
It happens every time  
  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You can say you've had enough  
But I won't stop calling,  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you  
  
When your fragile heart is breaking  
And your confidence is shaken  
I can tell you that we've all been there before  
The first step is hard to take  
But it's a choice you gotta make  
When life is waiting through that open door  
  
I wish that you could see  
The way you look to me  
  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You can say you've had enough

Oh, not so long ago,  
You pulled me through  
  
So I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Even if the rain comes down  
And your sky is falling  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You can say you've had enough  
But I won't stop calling,  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You know we can work this out  
If we just keep talking  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you

There's nothing here to keep us in this shanty town

Just throwing it all away.  
  
Go and fetch the captain's log and tear the pages out  
We're on our way to nowhere now, can't bring the helm about  
None of us are left in any doubt  
We won't be back again.  
  
Send a message to the fleet, they'll search for us in vain  
We won't be there among the reaches of the Spanish Main  
Tell the ones we left home not to wait  
We won't be back again.  
  
And come the day you'll hear them saying  
""They're throwing it all away""

Ourselves upon these rocks again.

The fam'ly round the tree  
We had a way of making X-mas morning  
As merry as can be  
  
I close my eyes and see  
Shiny faces  
Of all the children  
Who now have children of their own  
  
Funny  
But come December'

A politician's job they say is very high  
For he has to choose who's got to go and die  
They can put a man on the moon quite easy  
while people here on earth are dying of old diseases  
  
A woman goes to work every day after day  
She just goes to work just to earn her pay  
Child sitting crying by a life that's harder  
he doesn't even know who is his father

Britney Spears,Autumn Goodbye,/b/britney+spears/autumn+goodbye_20024645.html,"[Chorus]  
I never promised you a happy ending  
You never said you wouldn't make me cry  
But summer love will keep us warm long after  
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye.  
  
Thinking of you  
And the love of our lives  
In the sweet summertime  
so sad but true (so true, so true)  
We must leave it behind in our heart in our mind.  
From April through September  
Bittersweet was the love that we shared don't forget I remember  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Memories can make (they can make)  
But my heart has a place for the smile on your face  
And maybe someday (someday)  
We can be more than friends love will find us again.  
Red leaves and blue tomorrows  
Time will give back the love that we shared on the time that we borrowed  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
From April through September  
Bittersweet was the love that we shared don't forget I remember

They will remind, we won't forget  
The day we met  
The day we cried ooh  
Autumn goodbye

With bruised arms and broken rhythm and a beat-up old Buick but dressed just
like dynamite  
He tried sellin' his heart to the hard girls over on Easy Street  
But they said, ""Johnny, it falls apart so easily, and you know hearts these
days are cheap""  
And the pimps swung their axes and said, ""Johnny, you're a cheater""  
And the pimps swung their axes and said, ""Johnny, you're a liar""  
And from out of the shadows came a young girl's voice, said, ""Johnny, don't
cry""  
Puerto Rican Jane, oh, won't you tell me, what's your name?  
I want to drive you down to the other side of town  
Where paradise ain't so crowded and there'll be action goin' down on Shanty
Lane tonight  
All the golden-heeled fairies in a real bitch-fight  
Pull .38's and kiss their girls goodnight  
  
Goodnight, it's alright, Jane  
Now let them black boys in to light the soul flame  
We may find it out on the street tonight, baby  
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe  
  
Well, like a cool Romeo he made his moves, oh, she looked so fine  
Like a late Juliet, she knew she'd never be true but then, she really didn't
mind  
Upstairs a band was playin' and the singer was singin' something about going
home  
She whispered, ""Spanish Johnny, you can leave me tonight, but just don't leave
me alone""  
And Johnny cried, ""Puerto Rican Jane, word is down, the cops have found the
vein""  
Them barefoot boys left their homes for the woods  
Them little barefoot street boys, they said their homes ain't no good  
They left the corners, threw away their switchblade knives and kissed each
other goodbye  
  
Johnny was sittin' on the fire escape, watchin' the kids playin' down the
street  
He called down, ""Hey little heroes, summer's long, but I guess it ain't very
sweet around here anymore""  
Janey sleeps in sheets damp with sweat  
Johnny sits up alone and watches her dream on, dream on  
And the sister prays for lost souls, then breaks down in the chapel after
everyone's gone  
  
Jane moves over to share her pillow but opens her eyes to see Johnny up and
putting his clothes on  
She says, ""Those romantic young boys, all they ever want to do is fight  
Those romantic young boys, they're callin' through the window  
Hey, Spanish Johnny, you want to make a little easy money tonight?""  
  
And Johnny whispered, ""Goodnight, it's all tight, Jane  
I'll meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane

It ain't worth that much to my mind  
  
Lovin' you so easy  
It's hard to say goodbye

Just another one of those mysteries  
One more lover that used to be  
If you think you're in my head  
You been seriously misled  
  
Loving somebody ain't your average nine to five  
It takes conviction it takes a will to survive  
I'm not somebody who commits the crime  
And leaves the scene  
But when I've been dissed  
I don't spend much time on what might've been  
I'm not about self-pity  
Your love did me wrong  
So I'm movin', movin' on  
  
Just a page in my history  
Just another one of those mysteries  
One more lover that used to be

He was wearing new French suits  
While I mended my torn jeans

The horses stop going around  
There he was my poor rich man  
Lying on the Mexico ground  
All the sad music of his life  
Is still spinning in my mind  
The carousel starts up again  
And I found my place in life

Oh, I can't make mistakes now  
Oh, I've got to read your signs

my sister and I were headed straight for the top,  
my sister and earned a 'thou' a week at least, oh yea

I know its sad of course

its swell with two people,

then we'd

I'd say men,  
she'd say you're the cats meow  
then we'd wow the crowd again  
  
When she'd go  
I'd go  
we'd go  
  
Then those ding dong daddies started to roar  
whistled, stomped, stamped on the floor,  
yelling, screaming, begging for more,  
and we'd say  
Ok fellas, keep your socks on,  
Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

So what'd ya think huh?  
Come on you can say

I know you're right the first part is shit.  
But the second part, the second part is really nifty,

She'd go  
I'd go  
we'd  
  
Then those two-bit johnny's did it around  
to cheer the best attraction in town  
they nearly tore the balcony down,  
and we'd say: ok boys we're going home,  
but before we go here's a few more partin' shots,  
and this, this we did in perfect unison

Chicago,If She Would Have Been Faithful,/c/chicago/if+she+would+have+been+faithful_20030010.html,"I was thinking about her, visiting the past  
Reconstructing details with old photographs  
I was studying the faces with an objective point of view  
Suddenly remembering doesn't haunt me  
I'll follow the sun  
And now the time has come, and so, my love, I must go  
And though I lose a friend, in the end you will know oh  
One day you'll find that I have gone  
But tomorrow might rain so I'll follow the sun  
All the time you couldn't tell me that one day I'd be glad  
That something that I thought was love was misinterpreted  
  
But they were doing me a favor, a blessing in disguise  
If she would've been faithful, if she could have been true  
Then I would've been cheated, I would never know real love  
I would've missed out on you  
I watch you sleeping, your body touching me  
There's no doubt about it, this is where I want to be  
You know it's so ironic, I had to lose to win  
I want to thank her, if she would've been faithful  
If she could have been true  
Then I would've been cheated, I would never know real love  
I would've missed out on you  
It's a paradox full of contradiction, how I got from there to here  
It defies a logical explanation  
If she would've been faithful, if she could have been true  
Then I would've been cheated, I would never know real love  
I would've missed out on you  
If she would've been faithful, if she could have been true

Dodging here and there

Who is that down under  
Hugging that umbrella like a teddy bear  
  
Horns started blaring  
Everyone was staring  
At that strange object in the street  
Big black and shiny  
Covering someone tiny  
And all that we could see were two small feet  
  
Then a young policeman  
Called out from his beat  
""That umbrella there has a boy down deep""  
He swooped down under  
Pulled out Billy Blunder  
Just a tiny truant from his morning's sleep  
  
Now Billy Blunder  
Who was once down under  
Recites by heart his safety code  
""When you are out  
In rain or hail or thunder  
Hold up your umbrella when you cross the road! ""

Love was gonna be easy  
Gotta take the ups and downs  
The in betweens  
If you take this journey  
Gotta give yourself completely  
Never let nobody ever step on a dream  
  
You better stop  
Listen to these words I say  
You better stop  
Don't you throw this good thing away  
no no  
Put your trust in me  
And I'll make you see  
  
[Chorus]  
No the rain won't last forever  
Find a way to make it better  
Long as we can stand together  
Love will find a way  
Gonna make a new tomorrow  
Say good-bye to tears and sorrow  
Better listen when I say  
Love will find a way  
  
Somebody tried to tell me love  
doesn't last forever  
Said it only happens in your wildest dreams  
After all is said and done  
We're still here together  
Never listen to the lies and jealousy  
  
You better stop  
Don't you let them turn you around  
You better stop  
Hang onto this love that we've found  
Nothing ever say  
Can stand in our way

Don't want a doll, no dinky tinker Toy  
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy

I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?  
He won't have to use our dirty chimney flue  
Just bring him through the front door, that's the easy thing to do

Oh what joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes  
To see my hippo hero standing there  
  
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas  
Only a hippopotamus will do  
No crocodiles, no rhinoceroses  
I only like hippopotamuses  
And hippopotamuses like me too  
  
Mom says the hippo would eat me up, but then  
Teacher says a hippo is a vegeterian  
  
There's lots of room for him in our two-car garage  
I'd feed him there and wash him there and give him his massage  
I can see me now on Christmas morning, creeping down the stairs  
Oh what joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes  
To see a hippo hero standing there

And everyone wants a favor

And the days run hot and cold  
Are you under the power of gold?

You're a creature of habit, run like a rabbit  
Scared of a fear you can't name  
You own paranoia is looming before you  
But nobody thinks that it's a game  
  
Balance the cost of the soul you lost  
With the dreams you lightly sold

Growin' up came quietly in the arms of Maybel Joy  
Laughter found our morning's, brought new meaning to my life  
I woke up one day, Lord to find that I was by myself  
With dreams of Georgia cotton and California wine  
  
Sunday mornin' found me standin' 'neath the red-light of her door  
Right 'cross sent me reelin', laid me face down on the floor  
In place of Maybel Joy I found a merchant mad marine  
Who said, ""Your Georgia neck is red but son you're still green""  
  
Well, I turned twenty one in gray rock federal prison  
The judge, he had no mercy on this Waycross, Georgia boy  
Sometimes at night in silence, Lord, I'd listen  
That same old freight to take me back to Maybel Joy  
  
Cold nights had no pity on this Waycross, Georgia farm boy  
Springtime turned to summer and then the winter came  
Starin' at those four gray walls in silence, Lord, I'd listen  
Somewhere in the distance to the whistle of the train  
  
Sunday morning found me lying 'neath the red light of her door  
With a bullet in my side I cried, ""Have you seen Maybel Joy?""  
Stunned and shaken someone said, ""Son, she don't live here no more""  
She left this town ten years ago, I heard she's looking for

Just come up the hill 'cause there's a full moon on the risin'  
Hey baby, can't you steal away  
You know I really need to see you tonight  
I just got word you was packin' it in  
What's the matter, this old town got you crazy again  
I can see the sad look in your eyes  
But I don't know how to say goodbye  
And tomorrow, you're gonna have your day  
Take your wife and you're gonna run away  
Baby, while I'm wailin'  
You'll be sailin' like a hog across the bay singin'  
Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Baby, won't you come out tonight  
Oh baby, won't you come out tonight  
We'll run up the hill and we'll dance in the moonlight  
Let me gaze into your eyes 'til we both go blind  
Oh baby, can I see you tonight  
I'm just tryin' to find a way to make it last  
Good friends, they seem to slip away so fast  
An' I know we're both headed down separate tracks  
An' when ya' go, baby don't look back  
There won't be no more sleepin' over on a Tuesday night  
No more runnin' to the races for a dark horse at midnight  
No more dancin' after hours, singin' in the showers  
Or clingin' to each other in the soft mornin' light singin'  
Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la

Eat sushi raw or my catfish fried

And if you ain't, well, kiss my ham  
Country is as country does and I'm country to the bone  
  
Country is as country does  
It's the way I am and it's the way I was  
It's the way I always will be, that's for sure  
Country born and country bred  
Countrified and country-fed  
A country heart and a country head  
'Cause I'm country to the core  
  
Now, I can drive a tractor or a Cadillac  
I can fly first class or slum in the back  
But I'll be the same ol' gal when I arrive  
Oh I can wear denim or I can wear silk  
Drink champagne or chocolate milk  
Take the best or live with less, 'cause a country girl survives  
  
Country is as country does  
It's the way I am and it's the way I was  
And the way I'll be until they lay me low  
Country born and country bred  
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed  
And I'll be that way 'til I'm country dead  
'Cause I'm country head to toe  
  
And what you see is what you get  
Nothing's ever changed me yet  
Nothing will, it's a pretty safe bet  
'Cause I'm country through and through  
  
Oh, that's country!  
  
Country is as country does  
It's the way I am and it's the way I was  
It's the way I'll be until my dying day  
I'm country born and country bred  
Countrified and country-fed  
And nothing done and nothing said can change my country ways  
Nothing done and nothing said  
Nothing's gonna change my country ways

You know tonight is a very important night  
For me for a number of reasons  
My little girl is here tonight  
And I don't think you understand  
What it's like being the daughter of  
Someone who's always gone  
It's kind of scary and it's kind of lonely  
And I guess she thinks to herself sometimes  
""Is mummy ever going ever gonna come home?""  
And so my daughter looked up at me  
Last week and she said ""mummy  
When are you just gonna stay home  
One day and be with me""?  
And so it kinda struck me funny  
And I didn't realize that I hadn't spent  
Anytime with her for a long time  
So I sat down and wrote down this song  
After she went to bed  
And I told her tonight when it was bedtime  
I would sing her son  
I bet you ask yourself  
Why I'm never there  
It's not because I like being away  
You see I've made a spectacle of myself  
And it seems that the whole world needs me  
I understand when you cry alone  
And mama's not there to wipe your eyes  
You see it's only because  
I'm out being someone to make you cry  
I got a little letter  
And I read it on the plane  
And in my heart I felt a funny kind of pain  
I wish that I could be there  
To touch your face again  
Mimi you're beautiful  
Mimi you're mine  
And other things that I do in my life  
Seem to take up all your precious time  
There's so much I long to say  
So much more I long to do  
But I guess it's all just have to wait  
Till I can get to see you

Oh, Mimi you fill my life

When we walk hand-in-hand, the world becomes a wonderland

Drake,Say What's Real,/d/drake/say+whats+real_20782063.html,"Why do I feel so alone?  
Like everybody passing through the studio  
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role  
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know  
And I don't have the heart to give these  
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go  
So they stick around kicking out feedback  
And I entertain it as if I need that  
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that  
My privacy about the only thing I need back but  
It's hard to think of them polite flows  
Mr. Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes  
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes  
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed  
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows  
Life was so full  
Now this shit just being lipo'd  
Always said I'd say it all on the right track  
But in this game you only lose when you fight back  
Black diamond bracelets  
Showing you the basics  
I can't live and hold the camara  
Someone gotta tape this  
I make hits unlike a bitch  
That's married I ain't miss  
24 hours from greatness  
I'm that close  
Don't ever forget the moment  
You began to doubt  
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out  
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South  
Watchin' whole show  
Embarrassed to pull my camera out  
And my mother embarrassed  
To pull my Phantom out  
So I park about 5 houses down  
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown  
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around  
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus  
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness  
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus  
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless  
And promoters try to get me out to they club  
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how  
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl  
Standing with my next girl  
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now  
And shit could get weird unless they all down  
And so I stay clear  
  
We from a small town  
Everybody talks and everybody listen  
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing  
I've always been something that these labels can't buy  
Especially if they tryin' to take a peice of my soul  
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez ""Damn Drake fly""  
And he just be like ""Silly mother fucker I know""  
That was your bad  
How could you pass up on 'em?  
He just take them records  
And he gas up on 'em  
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em  
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em  
Oh they did Po  
At least they tried to  
And that's what happens  
When you spitting what's inside you  
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video  
And they think they can market you  
However they decide to nahh  
But Forty told me to do me  
And don't listen to anybody that knew me  
'Cause to have known me would  
Mean that there's a new me  
And if you think I changed in the slightest  
Could of fooled me  
Boy in my city I'm da 2-3  
Drug dealers live vicariously through me  
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy  
I'm just not the social type  
And campus life is crazy understand  
I could get money with my eyes closed  
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo  
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll  
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know  
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will  
I got new shit  
I'm gettin' better still  
Little niggas put my name in they verses  
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal  
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill  
And I think this got this ""Making of a Legend"" feel  
Problem with these other niggas they  
Ain't never real  
Yea that's all I can say

But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy.  
And I'm focused on my survival.  
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival.  
Who do you look up to when you're better then your idols.  
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed.  
I'm everything you just haven't become.  
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done.  
Now hopefully let them see,  
What they say that I'm gon' be,  
And if not our whole future does in the memory of me.  
Get your team in order, assembly is key.  
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea.  
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be,  
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty.  
Pick a lane pick a lane. That's all I ever heard.  
But I'm just trying to swerve.  
Without hitting the curb.  
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them.  
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them.  
I am not them. I Photoshop them, out.  
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about.  
Yeah.

And you just wanna be yourself

It is when all the press articles happening  
And the cameras get to snappin  
And they try to make you out as a lie  
Symbolic cos you were just trying to please em'  
By using logic and reason  
It's a lose lose why even try  
When your ideas so frequently get rejected and people just get neglected  
And They never really know how to feel  
Phone calls is something that you're expecting  
For someone without ethics to try and make em a mill  
You never noticed the fact you might be working what I'm receivin' at first  
And niggas wanna say that you ain't around  
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself (yourselves)  
Instead of claimin' that you couldn't help and maybe next time you were
(ain't) In town  
  
Chorus:  
You gonna try to try harder cos  
Try harder cos  
  
Try -Try-Try-Try  
  
And the managers make you circum to pressure  
And you spitin' the pressure than most of the rappers running the game  
Concerned that people who copy what's in the past  
And turn the profit to cash  
There's time I would have done it the same  
I mean I got me a range  
Also got me a guilty conscience  
That made you tell anybody I meet that I ran  
Sometimes I wish that I woulda' just chilled on the sneakers  
And watched the game from the bleachers  
Cos I'm really telling me what I spent  
In a house that I promised to get my mother  
Don't compensate for the other time  
I wasted late out at the club  
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner  
I working hard on the winner so this album is a labour of love  
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets  
And just spending money on beats that  
She can rest without a toss and a turn  
Cos she know that my reputation perceives me  
And people watch me on tv  
That's exactly why I often get burned  
But I'm gonna try to.

Searching, Fearless  
where do I begin to heal this wound of self-denial?  
  
Face yourself man!  
Brace yourself and trace your hell back.  
  
You've been  
Blinded,  
Living lie a one way  
Cold existence,  
All the while.  
Now it's  
Time to  
Stare the problem right between  
The eyes  
You long lost child.  
  
I want to feel your body breaking,

And shaking,  
And left in the cold.  
I want to heal your conscience making  
A change to fix this dying soul.  
This Dying Soul.  
  
Born into this world a broken home  
Surrounded by love yet all alone  
Forced into a life that's split in two  
A mother and a father both pulling you  
Then you had to deal with loss and death  
Everybody thinking they know best  
Coping with this shit at such an age  
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage  
Family disease pumped through your blood  
Never had the chance you thought you could  
Running all the while with no escape  
Turning all that pain in to blame and hate  
Living on your own by twenty one  
Not a single care and having fun  
Consuming all the life in front of you  
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue  
  
Possessive obsessions,  
Selfish childish games.  
Vengeful resentments,  
Passing all the blame.  
  
Living out a life of decadence  
Acing without thought of consequence  
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast  
While spitting on the ones that matter most  
Running power mad with no control  
Fighting for the credit they once stole  
No one can ever tell you what to do  
Ruling other's lives while the can't stand the thought of you  
  
A living reflection,  
Seen from miles away.  
A hopeless affliction,  
Having run astray.  
  
I want to feel your body breaking,  
Want to feel your body breaking,  
And shaking,  
And left in the cold.  
I want to heal your conscience making  
A change to fix this dying soul.

Now that you can see  
All you have done,  
It's time to take that step  
Into the kingdom.  
All your sins will  
Only make you strong,  
And help you break right  
Through the prison wall.  
  
Come to me my friend  
(Listen to me)  
I'll help this torture end  
(Help to set me free)  
Let your ego go  
(I can't carry this load)  
You can't go through this alone  
(I feel so hopeless and exposed)  
You'll find your peace of mind  
(Give me some direction)  
You can no longer hide  
(Break out of this isolation)  
Let humility  
(Openness, honesty)  
And become what you can be

Help me,  
Save me,  
Heal me,  
I can't break out of this prison all alone.  
  
These tormenting ghosts of yesterday,  
Will vanish when exposed.  
You can't hold onto your secrets,  
They'll only send you back alone.  
  
Your fearless admissions  
Will help expel your destructive obsessions.  
With my help I know you can  
Be at one with God and man.  
  
Hear me,  
Believe me,  
Take me,  
I'm ready to break right through this prison wall.

But the pen that I write with won't tell the truth  
But the moments that I care about are moments that I treasure  
Better take another measure for pleasure  
  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
  
I count the pages of the letter I write  
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine  
Tearin' up the sheets of love this hand could not disguise  
I'll start to count again and close my eyes  
  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
  
Now you're here  
I'm here too  
Can be this easy for me and you  
  
Now you're here  
I'm here too

Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
  
Layin' about, lying in bed  
Could be something that I thought I said

Eagles,Try And Love Again,/e/eagles/try+love+again_20044487.html,"When you're out there on your own  
Where your memories can find you  
Like a circle goes around  
You were lost until you found out  
What it all comes down to  
  
One by one  
The lonely feelings come  
Day by day, they slowly fade away  
  
Ooh, the look was in her eyes  
You never know what might be found there  
She was dancing right in time  
And the moves she made so fine  
Like the music that surrounds her  
  
Should I stay or go?  
I really want to know  
Would I loose or win  
If I try and love again?  
Oh oh oh gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh I'm gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh gonna try and love  
  
Right or wrong, what's done is done  
It's only moments that you borrow  
But the thoughts will linger on  
Of the lady and her song  
When the sun comes up tomorrow  
  
Well, it might take years  
To see through all these tears  
Don't let go  
When you find it you will know  
  
Oh oh oh, gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh, gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh, gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh

Sometimes you need a friend

It's like a broken record  
(Numa numa)  
Saying that your heart hurts  
(Numa numa)  
That you never get over him getting over you  
(Numa numa)  
And you end up crying

And I end up lying

And when the phone call finally ends  
You say, ""thanks for being a friend""  
(Numa numa)  
And we're going in circles again and again

I dedicate this song to you  
The one who never sees the truth  
That I can take away your hurt, heartbreak girl  
Hold you tight, straight through the daylight  
Anyone can  
I'm right here when you gonna realize  
That I'm your cure, heartbreak girl?

And you'll finally forget the day you met him

I've gotta get it through your head  
That you belong with me instead anyone can

Who seems to be so close to you instead  
Close to you instead  
  
I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad  
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad  
I guess I cannot have everything  
So much has flown between the years  
When I was twenty and you were seventeen  
  
So out of choice I chose rock and roll  
But it pushed me to the limit everyday  
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home  
From there on, there seemed no use for you  
For you to stay  
  
And if I shower around 3 a.m.  
It's just to wash away  
The trace of a love unwanted  
Oh in the times I went astray  
The times I went astray  
  
So much has flown between the years

Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yes sir  
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills for my dresser

Performed a home abortion with Dexter the ni yeser  
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanging then digest her

We said 'I do' and took off on our honeymoon  
The seashore sure was nice, we made love day and night  
We were so much in love, we never got out of the room  
  
Then spring time turned to fall and I was proud and walkin' tall  
She was happy but mad 'cause she couldn't fit into her dress  
I spent all of my afternoons fixin' up our extra room  
For a boy named Bill or a little girl named Tess  
  
And it was late on a winter night, we were sittin' by the fiery light  
And she said to me, ""Hun, I think it's time to go""  
Oh, I was a nervous wreck, I almost broke my neck  
Tryin' to back up the car and hurry through the snow  
  
But I got her there just in time and they dressed us both in white  
And I held her hand while they wheeled her into the room  
And there right before my eyes the miracle of life  
Came cryin' at me and I'd never felt so good  
  
Ooh, what a beautiful baby she gave me  
I never knew that my life was so empty and so incomplete  
Ooh, what a beautiful baby she gave me  
She looks like her mama but she's smilin' just like me

hide from this even with your best defense you can't deny the way you feel
about me i know you think about it all of time but there's nothing left to
make you change your mind i know you think you're doing what is right but
you're acting on frustration out of spite and i don't want to say another word
to start a fight and if you're so convinced that we're so wrong you're still
standing here where you've been all along it doesn't make much difference
where we think that we belong

Looking for a strand to climb  
Looking for a little hope  
Baby said he couldn't stay  
Wouldn't put his lips to mine  
And a fail to kiss is a fail to cope  
I said honey I don't feel so good  
Don't feel justified

A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel

For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

On horses snortin' flame an' fire, as they ride on, hear them cry

George Harrison,Here Comes The Moon,/g/george+harrison/here+comes+the+moon_20059041.html,"Everybody's talking up a storm  
Act like they don't notice it  
But here it is and here it comes  
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon.  
  
Impulse always quickens when it's full  
As it turns my head around me  
Yes it does and here it comes  
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon.  
  
God's gift I see that's moving up there into the night  
Though dark the mirror in the sky reflects us our light:  
Looks like a little brother to the sun  
Or mother to the stars at night  
And here it is and here it comes  
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon.  
  
Breath is always taken when it's new  
Enhance upon the clouds around it  
Yes it is and here it comes  
Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon.

I think it's best we put it all behind before we wind up getting hurt.  
No hard feelings darling, no regrets,  
No tears and no broken hearts.  
Call it quits, calling off all bets, it just wasn't in the cards.

They're after my shoes  
And anything else they can find on the shelf  
I've said they could use  
And just look at my face  
When you tell me goodbye  
You'll see what I'm after  
By the look in my eye  
Just walk away and leave me alone  
It's a long way back home  
It's a long way back home

Feeling the pain  
Of love lost running though  
My brain  
Looking at the wind  
Watching it spin  
The leaves along the street  
You win  
  
Waiting for a line to fall  
Telling you it's all a big mistake  
  
Looking at a face  
So out of place  
Inside that picture frame  
Of lace  
Looking at the wall  
Wishing you'd call  
And tell me you're okay  
That's all  
  
Wishing this was all a dream  
And I'd find you sleeping when I wake  
  
Looking at the trees  
So ill at ease  
From sleep that will not come  
That's me  
Looking at the dawn  
Knowing it's wrong  
Still thinking of your love  
That's gone  
  
Wishing this was all a dream  
And I'd find you sleeping when I wake

Waiting for a line to fall  
Telling you it's all a big mistake  
But the words won't come  
I know I'd feel the same

Office parties and wedding pals and tacky pictures on the walls  
  
Pretty barmaid to and fro the barman plays the songs we know  
She gets into 'twist and shout' and it's boozing time and I'm down and out

Riding on the roadside the dust gets in your eyes  
Reveling, disheveling, the summer nights can bring

Slanted rays and colored days, stark blue horizons  
Naked limbs and wheat bins, hazy afternoons  
Voicing, rejoicing, the wine cups do bring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Harsh nights and candlelights, woodfires a-blazin'  
Soft lips and fingertips resting in my soul  
Treasuring, remembering, the promise of spring

Well Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair,  
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair,  
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind.  
When first he saw this woman, you know he couldn't believe his mind.  
  
Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee,  
Said tell me where your strength lies if you please.  
She spoke so kind and she talked so fair,  
Well Samson said, Delilah cut off my hair.  
  
You can shave my head, clean as my hand  
And my strength will become as natural as any old man.  
  
If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,  
I would tear this old building down.  
  
You read about Samson, all from his works,  
He was the strongest man that ever had lived on earth.  
One day when Samson was walking along,  
Looked down on the ground, he saw an old jawbone.  
  
He stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like thread,  
When he got to moving, ten thousand was dead.  
  
If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,  
I would tear this old building down.  
  
Now Samson and the lion, they got in a tack,  
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back.  
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws,  
But Samson got his hands around that lion's jaws.  
  
He ripped the beast till he killed him dead.  
The bees made honey in the lion's head.  
  
If I had my way, if I had my way, if I had my way,

Therell be gathered there great armies for that battle on that day.

Theres been trobles and tribulation, therell be sorrow and despair.

Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with him at last.  
  
Turn the pages of your bible, in st. Matthew you will see,  
Start with chapter twenty-four and read from one to thirty-three.  
In our saviors blessed words he said on earth, he prophesised,  
For he spoke of this great battle that is coming by and by.

"Harry Connick, Jr.",Swinging On A Star,/h/harry+connick+jr/swinging+on+a+star_20629920.html,"Would you like to swing on a star?  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar?  
And be better off than you are?  
Or would you rather be a mule?  
  
A mule is an animal with long, funny ears  
He kicks up at anything he hears  
His back is brawny and his brain is weak  
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak  
And, by the way, if you hate to go to school  
You may grow up to be a mule  
  
Or would you like to swing on a star?  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar?  
And be better off than you are?  
Or would you rather be a pig?  
  
A pig is an animal with dirt on his face  
His shoes are a terrible disgrace  
He's got no manners when he eats his food  
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude  
But if you don't care a feather or a fig  
You may grow up to be a pig  
  
[Instrumental-first 3 lines of chorus]  
Or would you rather be a fish?  
  
A fish won't do anything but swim in a brook  
He can't write his name or read a book  
To fool all the people is his only thought  
Though he's slippery, he still gets caught  
But then if that sort of life is what you wish  
You may grow up to be a fish  
  
And all the monkeys aren't in a zoo  
Every day you meet quite a few  
So you see, it's all up to you  
You can be better than you are  
  
You could be swingin' on a star

Creatures in anguish no place to flee  
Living their nightmares the fall from grace  
And so I'm standing here

Ragged after fights  
Hold up your sword  
You're leaving the light  
  
Make yourself ready  
For the lords of the dark  
They'll watch your way  
So be cautious, quiet and hark

In the crowns of the trees  
You're whirling 'round  
But your eyes don't agree

You can't throw a curse  
Without takin' their wrath

Our only hope's your victory  
Kill that Satan who won't let us be--kill!

To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold

Running down your neck  
And the dwarfs of falseness  
Throw mud at your back

Fulfull your own promise and do what's divined  
The seven seas are far away  
Placed in the valley of dust heat and sway

Throw the second key into the sea of fear  
Throw the third key into the sea of senselessness

The fourth key belongs into the sea of greed  
  
And the fifth into the sea of ignorance

For this whole world's in devil's hand  
Disease, disease, disease my friend  
Throw the key or you may die  
  
On a mound at the shore of the last sea  
He is sitting, fixing your sight  
With his high iron voice causing sickness  
He is playing you out with delight  
  
""Man who do you just think you are?  
A silly bum with seven stars  
Don't throw the key or you will see  
Dimensions cruel as they can be""  
  
Don't let him suck off your power  
Throw the key...!  
  
An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground  
Satan's screaming, and earth swallowing him away!  
  
You're the Keeper of the Seven Keys  
You locked up the Seven Seas  
And the Seer of Visions can now rest in peace  
There ain't no more demons and no more disease  
And mankind, live up, you're free again  
Yes the tyrant is dead, he is gone, overthrown  
You have given our souls back to light

My Baby, how beautiful you are  
My Darling, completely torn apart  
You're gone with the sin my Baby and beautiful you are  
You're gone with the sin my Darling  
  
I adore the despair in your eyes  
I worship your lips once red as wine  
I crave for your scent sending shivers down my spine  
I just love the way you're running out of life

Cursing the Gods we have become  
We steal the fire from a sacred heart  
And bleed the wine unholy  
We fall in love with the serpent's song  
And fear nothing  
  
In the nightside of Eden  
We're born again -  
Dead  
  
""Forever we are  
Forever we've been  
Forever will be crucified to a dream""  
  
Deranged we're tearing away the petals of desire  
Learning the mathematics of evil by heart  
We deceive ourselves to start a war  
Within the realm of senses  
And descend to the circle number four  
Where we are nothing  
  
In the nightside of Eden  
We're born again -  
Dead  
  
""Forever we are  
Forever we've been  
Forever will be crucified to a dream""

Here's to the pain the light of the oncoming train  
Come on ode to solitude in chains  
Here's to the pain as always heaven in flames now bleeding

Loosen the noose love loosen the noose with love  
What I want to know is why you keep me hanging

Remember not to forget this feeling you have

Horrible Histories,Australia Song,/h/horrible+histories/australia+song_21080054.html,"[Verse 1]  
In Britain's Georgian times  
There were so many crimes  
No time to hang each crook guilty of a felony  
Cos there's no room to jail you  
They'd send you to Australia  
To live in our new-fangled penal colony  
Think that sounds like heaven?  
In 1787, it wasn't that kind of once in a lifetime trip  
First fleet took the journey  
Months at sea so churny  
Over 40 died while they were on the ship  
  
[Chorus]  
Those that lived were plucky  
Plucky, plucky, plucky  
Crammed on board with rats and vermin, cockroaches in bed  
Stench inside was sicky  
Yucky, yucky, icky  
Lice not very nice, can't get them out of my head  
  
[Verse 2]  
Landed Bay of Botany  
Convicts' life was rotteny  
Needed food and shelter but everything failed  
Threes too strong for felling  
Stagnant water smelling  
A real step back in time in New South Wales  
Soil too poor for budding  
Huts washed up by flooding  
Plans for building houses came to sticky ends  
The best of all their labours  
Attacked by local neighbours  
And that is when your neighbours don't become good friends  
  
[Chorus]  
Situation tricky  
Tricky, tricky, tricky  
Then a second fleet of ships was due aground  
Some thought this was lucky  
But illness had strucky  
Half were dead or I'll  
Fever was spinning around  
  
[Verse 3]  
After seven years  
Convict record clears  
Just one catch  
You got to pay your own way back  
No wages meant no money  
No choice, but what's funny  
Many stayed, became farmers and made a stack  
Original arrivers  
Proved hardy survivors  
Sydney turned into a place you'd choose to go  
Think that they'd be fairer  
To convicts who were sent there?  
No way they built prisons even more remote  
  
[Verse 4]  
Port Arthur was one of the jails  
Where every escape attempt fails  
Was one man who nearly got through  
Billy Hunt dressed as a kangaroo

Inmate's life still sucky  
Sucky, sucky, sucky  
Life behind bars was not very nice  
Hideous and messy

Holiday paradise?

His body lay without motion

My attention was caught  
By a sound from the door  
Panic gripped the mind  
What lay in store  
A being stared at me  
Benevolent, not cold

Just to find my heart is beating

For three nights straight now I dream I keep both of my shoes  
But I've forgotten my lines  
And I've misplaced my cues  
And there's a sea full of faces and a show to go on,  
And I'm struck mute at entrance with nothing to draw from

And if I was a Serial Killer  
I would be strange and deranged

If I was a Serial Killer  
I'd be known as the smoker  
Cause I'd cut off and smoke all they hair  
And if I was a Serial Killer  
I would sleep on broken glass and thumbtacks  
And I would smoke mad crack

First thing I would do is kill a couple hotties  
They'd always get some mustard up decapitated bodies  
Dumped on State police law just before dawn  
To let em know my ritual had begun  
I'd crack a 40 with the devil tell him dig me a hole  
Cause I'm coming when I die until them I'm in control  
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I ain't  
But if I was I'd do my walls all blood red with blood paint  
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I ain't  
But if I was I'd never stop cause I know I can't

And I would ride around on college campus  
And if I was a Serial Killer  
I would walk among us and gain trust  
Until I needed that rush

I'd park outside these bitches homes and then drive away  
Then come back with my lights off this time I'm here to stay  
I'd wear human bones around my neck and have my ceremonies  
Then go back upstairs and microwave some macaronis  
You know what's all up in my trunk  
So don't ask me to pop it  
Once I get out to my cabin  
Then I'll finally unlock it  
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I'm not  
But if I was I'd snap a photo once they died on the spot  
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I'm not  
But if I was I'd know that I can't so I would never stop

Don't know which anymore  
So many full of life  
But also filled with pain  
Don't know just how many  
Will live to breathe again  
  
A life that's made to breathe  
Destruction or defense  
A mind that's vain corruption  
Bad or good intent  
A wolf in sheep's clothing  
Or saintly or sinner  
Or some that would believe  
A holy war winner  
  
They fire off many shots  
And many parting blows  
Their actions beyond a reasoning  
Only God would know  
And as he lies in heaven  
Or it could be in hell  
I feel he's somewhere here  
Or looking from below  
But I don't know, I don't know

Please tell me now what love is  
Well tell me now what war is  
Again tell me what life is

Sometimes it seems more like  
The blind leading the blind  
It brings upon us more famine, death and war  
You know religion has a lot to answer for

And as they search to find the bodies in the sand  
They find its ashes that are  
Scattered across the land  
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind  
A shot is fired somewhere another war begins  
  
And all because of it you'd think  
That we would learn  
But still the body count the city fires burn  
Somewhere there's someone dying  
In a foreign land  
Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man  
Tell me why, tell me why

Who never mourn his loss

To feel the pain again  
Tell me why, tell me why

Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on
opening nights  
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there
in lights  
  
There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low  
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's

Where could you get money that you don't give back? let's go on with the show

They say my music's too loud  
I kept talkin about it  
I got the big run around  
When I rolled with the punches  
I got knocked on the ground  
With all this bullshit going down  
Time is truly wastin'  
There's no guarantee  
Smile's in the makin'  
You gotta fight the powers that be  
  
If you I can - we got the power  
Fight it, got the power fight it...baby, baby  
Fight it, fight the power

One by one in the silence they all walk away  
And I will worship You for all that You are

But there's joy, blessed joy in the morning sky

I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga  
Fuck you cause there  
There is no right or wrong, only a song  
I like to write alone, be in my zone  
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home  
But the only thing like home I've ever known  
Until they snatched it from my mama  
And foreclosed her on the loan  
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone  
I was up in New York City chasin' panties, gettin' dome  
Had no clue what you was goin' through  
How could you be so strong?  
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish  
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl  
Damn she so selfless, but she put up with my way  
Because she loves me like you do  
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you  
And I need to treat you better  
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together

Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me  
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy  
Give a virgin the urge to rape me  
Nigga please  
Best friends really make great for enemies

But I was ridin' on fumes so I stopped by the moon

Waitin' on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist

little iller  
Yup, Fayettenam, n-gga  
  
Yea, Carolina blue kicks pedal to the medal  
Feeling like a puppet and the devil is Geppetto  
Letter to the ghetto-hold ya head high  
You can pick apart my raps I ain't told ya na' lie  
I want a little darker, like to f-cking tan line  
Go on, look for a better n-gga, girl you can't find  
Fine young man with an old man mind,  
No time for the tickle, f-ck the whole mankind  
Aw no ma'am, I'm an old land mine  
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time, now I'm armed and I'm-  
Fayettenam's finest, Carolina saviour, marijuana blazer  
Only on occasion cause my mind be racing  
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian  
Thinking how these rap n-ggas got to be faking  
Whole style obviously copied, pasted-plagiarized swag  
May arrived last but when it's all said and done I'ma be ahead of them  
Way that I describe it, prescribe a n-gga medicine  
Way that I be fly-I be higher than the Jet-e-sons  
Moving on up, n-gga higher than the Jeffersons  
All about the Benjamin's, bad chicks send em' in!  
Basic hoes toss em out! Can't even get waffle house  
Hating n-ggas chalk em out! Go and get the coffin out

No, not up top, but down there  
She said she want to hop on top girl I don't care  
You better get yours before I reach mines cause then I'm throwing peace signs  
If you a freak I can take you to ya peak, girl I do it to the maxima-Nissan

To tell the truth, I'm only f-cking with a few n-ggas, if that!  
The rest of ya'll n-ggas get lapped  
I sit back, and reflect on the rap game I came from out of no where  
N-gga, I swear them lames ain't know how to prepare  
Got n-ggas shouting out ""The Ville-I got to go there! ""  
Boy, don't you know you get shot over there?  
I say my prayers cause this life ain't fair,  
A bunch of backstabbing n-ggas hope the knife ain't there  
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain't there  
Yea late at night, when I got the phone call and made her right  
When my crib was straight ahead, shorty gave me head, hit it then I quit it
'fore she even made the bed  
Damn I'm no good  
But damn it's so good  
I'm picturing that body like a camera phone would  
Something like Rihanna while I'm up in that vagina  
Type of chick that only dress in something that's designer  
I could give a f-ck long as there's something that's behind her  
Got the type of bump that make a dog want to hump her  
Back to the topic-actually forgot it

Hey, Dear Mr. Policeman  
Hey am I wrong, aint you suppose to keep the peace man?  
I coulda swore I was driving pretty peaceful  
So why the hell is you pullin over me fo'?  
Is it this black Mercedes? (Oh now I get it, I get it, I get it)  
Or cause I'm black? Hmmm, maybe  
Hey, tell me why my hands start sweatin and I hold my breath everytime that  
You get behind me  
I turn my music down, so you won't hear a sound, man I'm nervous like I got  
A couple pounds on me  
You pulled me over, you frown on me  
With your flashlight, tell me what do you see

Mothafuckin college degree

Yea, my middle finger to the law, bustin off, tryna touch the sky  
My teacher said, ""Impossible"", but I'mma fuckin try  
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules  
There's niggas dying everyday, but we don't make the news

Hey your honor, is you kidding? How you sit above me?

These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff

At the end of the day, you n-ggas just like us

Jackson Browne,Say It Isn't True,/j/jackson+browne/say+it+isnt+true_20068567.html,"In the still of the night  
Lying in the darkness  
I listen to my heart  
Say it isn't true  
In the dark and the quiet  
The movements of my love  
And the breathing of our children  
Say it isn't true  
In the streets and the buildings  
People in their lives  
And the jobs they do for livings  
Say it isn't true  
And when you think of all the people  
In the cities of the worlds  
Who could vanish in a moment  
Say it isn't true  
Say it isn't true  
(That there always has been and always will be war)  
Say it isn't true  
(And apart from all the finer things that men have struggled for)  
Say it isn't true  
(There always has been and always will be war)  
Say it isn't true  
I'm alive in the city  
In a country of the world  
And I wanna go on living  
I wanna see my life unfold  
You know it's hard to go on looking  
At the stories of our days  
And the dangers we are facing  
Growing worse in every way  
And you would think with all of the genius  
And the brilliance of these times  
We might find a higher purpose  
And a better use of mind  
Say it isn't true  
(That there always has been and always will be war)  
Say it isn't true  
(And apart from all the finer things that men have struggled for)  
Say it isn't true  
(There always has been and always will be war)  
Say it isn't true  
Say it  
Say it isn't

One place pretty much like another  
Some folks got a pretty good deal  
Some are just looking for their next meal  
Out here where the days go by  
And the glances never meet the eye  
It's a walking town  
And I'm just out here walking 'round  
Walking 'round this walking town  
  
You got a house on top of a hill  
And a powerful automobile  
The windows up, the AC high  
In a world of comfort speeding by  
Stressed out in the latest style  
How long has it been since you walked a mile  
In yours or anybody else's shoes  
Well, in any life there will be dues  
It's a walking town  
And I'm just out here walking 'round  
Walking 'round this walking town  
  
Walking up, walking down  
Walking back, walking 'round  
Walking mute, walking bound  
Walking through your walking town  
  
One foot on the concrete shore  
One foot in the human sea  
Night falls on the streets of the city  
And it falls over you and me  
And all our dreams and our descriptions  
Of the life this was supposed to be  
Drift above the rooftops and the houses  
Until the sunlight finds me where I lay  
And it's a walking town  
And I'm back out here walking 'round  
Walking 'round this walking town

And as it was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end  
That bullshit is bullshit, it just goes by different names  
  
All the things that I shout about (but never act upon)  
All the courage and the dreams that I have

The dignified don't even enter in the game  
  
And if you feel there's no passion  
No quality sensation  
Seize the young determination  
Show the fakers you ain't foolin'  
You'll see me come runnin'  
To the sound of your strummin'  
Fill my heart with joy and gladness  
I've lived too long in shadows of sadness

While hundreds are homeless, they're constructing a parking space  
  
Why do they have to knock them down  
And leave the site dormant for months on end?

A man whose home has cost forty grand

Bumped into emptiness and started to cry, oh no

Around this place amongst streaming sunshine.  
Scared I was, sweating now.  
Feeling of doom, my bowels turned to water  
  
I felt hot breath whisper in my ear  
I looked for somewhere to hide but every wheres closed  
I shut my eyes pretend not to be here

Come tumbling in  
Freezing us all

Beating the pier  
As we try and sleep

Together they would blanket the world with light  
But the moon had a shadow, he felt like a liar  
The sun was the only one who carried the fire  
The sun saw this, she kept on glowing  
Bound to the moon, never saying, ""you owe me""

We ain't that different, we huddle underneath the same stars  
I see who you really are  
You're every creature, every man, every woman and child  
You're the closest thing I'll ever get to knowing God  
Like the sun to the moon, I'll send my love and light  
A love like ours, it'll fill the whole sky

Send them your light and hope it glows  
Say I will shine on you, I will shine on you  
No matter the distance, the space, or the time  
Love travels in the speed of light  
I will shine on you, I will shine on you  
I will shine on you, I will shine on you

Turn your eyes to the attention of the morning sun  
Wherever you go, however you move  
The light is gonna shine directly to you

Between a thousand railroad ties  
From Boston down to New Orleans  
I left the girls a cryin'  
But I've still got some ramblin' in me  
Got some miles left on my shoes  
And before I take a job again  
I'll have to be low-down  
Cryin' the blues  
So it's goodbye, baby, the whistle is a blowin'  
If I miss the train I'll have to stay around  
But as long as those railroad tracks go on unending  
I'll be off to another day in another town  
  
You say you'd like to ramble with me  
This ain't no life for a girl  
Too many people out to get you in a hobo's world  
And it gets mighty cold when you're on the road  
'Cause a boxcar never was a home  
But you could join me if you want  
I'm gettin' mighty tired of bein' alone  
So it's goodbye, baby, the whistle is a blowin'

Thinkin' about all the money he made,  
couldn't help to ease his mind  
Havana daydreamin' oh he's just dreamin' his life away.  
  
Daddy shucked that sugar cane,  
One day he fell dead.  
Jesus had a wanderin' feelin'  
Swimmin around in his head.  
Sailin' on a midnight boat,  
There were no questions asked,  
Water's so green and the air was so clean  
That he stuck right to his task, Havana daydreamin',  
Oh he's just schemin', his life away.  
  
Ceilin' fan stirs the air  
Cigar smoke did swirl,  
A fragrance on the pillow case  
And he thinks about the girl.  
Spillin' wine wine and sharin' good times  
She sure could make him smile.  
He pays her well but what the hell

Strolling cross the broad Savannah's

In time she's gonna learn to fly

John Denver,Country Love,/j/john+denver/country+love_20073813.html,"Nashville tears are lonely signs that point to broken hearts  
Broken lives and families that love has split apart  
Children who miss daddy, mommy's on the run  
The pleasure that is painful and hidden from the sun  
  
Nashville hearts are lonely words that speak of love gone wrong  
Sad and soulful stories and beautiful love songs  
Foe each and every melody of happiness denied  
You know that there's another one that shows the other side  
  
Country love is kisses in the kitchen  
Country love is honest and it's true  
Country love is home with your family  
County love's the way that I love you  
  
Country love is silky nights and warm familiar hands  
Someone who's been there before and always understands  
  
Nashville nights are lonely roads that we've all traveled on  
Sometimes they take you far away or they can bring you home  
If you're lost out on the highway, do not deny the dove  
When Nashville night's the question, the answer's country love  
  
Country love is kisses in the kitchen  
Country love is honest and it's true  
Country love is home with your family  
County love's the way that I love you

We can't run out of magic  
It's the only way we know  
Let's trip the night fantastic  
Light it up 'til we both explode  
We love, we love, we love the stars  
We could fall so hard  
The drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars  
Why'd we ball so hard?  
Yeah, and I, I'm not afraid to fly  
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing  
And we're not afraid to die

We've got a lot of nerve, girl  
We walk around here like we own this place  
  
See my jewels dripping on my Timberlands  
Stepping like a criminal, success is so imminent  
Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce  
Eggplant double-breasted suit from Tom Ford  
Bon voyage, left haters in the fog  
Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss  
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us  
Still actin' shy like this is summer class crush  
Money comin' fast, I'm never in a rush, no  
Plus another twenty in a tuck  
Semi in a truck, another forty on the wrist  
Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin' like I pitch  
Dodging Robin Givens, boiling like I'm Roger Clemens  
Still in the game, uniform all linen  
She get Chanel, ski trips to Vail  
Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale  
  
And I, I'm not afraid to fly  
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing  
And we're not afraid to die  
Who do we think we are?

The harp that once through tara's halls  
The soul of music shed  
Now hangs as mute on tara's walls  
As if that soul were fled  
So sleeps the pride of former days  
So glory's thrill is o'er  
And the hearts that once beat high for praise  
Now feel that pulse no more  
No more to chiefs and ladies bright  
The harp of tara swells  
The chord alone that breaks at night  
Its tale of ruin tells  
Thus freedom now so seldom wakes  
The only throb she gives  
Is when some heart indignant breaks  
To show that still she lives

And my hands they have been tied  
To a life I've been denied  
I'm just a small town boy bein' used like a toy  
And workin' from nine to five  
  
By the end of the day, all the kids would go play  
And I'd come staggering home  
With a dream in my hand and a master plan  
That wouln't leave my mind alone

And flucturated all my dreams

The young girls fall back and say  
There goes that sleek young silhouette  
He don't drive no Corvette  
But he stings just like a Sting Ray  
And that's my only redemption in this house of detention  
That keeps me from simply blowin' it all away

I say, God don't take this away

You feeling that way too  
Or am I just,

She'll be there standing by the light  
Once she's bee to where she's gone to  
She should know wrong from right  
  
A new road's waiting, you touched my life  
Soft and warm on a summer's night  
You're the only one, the only one I love  
The lovely one, I'm thinking of

Turn again and turn towards this time,

Then again the same old story,  
Word will travel, oh so quickly,  
Travel first and lean towards this time.  
  
Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown,  
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time,  
Watching her, these things she said,  
The times she cried,  
Too frail to wake this time.  
  
Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown,

Picture me and then you start watching,  
Watching forever, forever,  
Watching love grow, forever,  
Letting me know, forever.

Born to be kissed?  
Born to find the one to show me what I missed?

Born just to cry?

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

To make you walk out and leave me cold

To make it so that you were right here, right now  
  
I've been sitting here

Now I don't wanna make excuses, baby  
Won't change the fact that you're gone  
But if there's something that I could do, won't you please let me know  
Time is passing so slowly now, guess that's my life without you  
And maybe I could change my everyday, but baby I don't want to  
  
So I'll just hang around and find some things to do

And gathered all above  
While mortals sleep, the Angels keep  
Their watch of wondering love

The rain and the way that felt never let up all week  
By Thursday I knew everything about her  
And God, the last day I didn't wanna leave without her

That old pier ran clear out into the mist

Again and again, and again  
  
I taste that saltwater taffy on her lips  
And Wednesday morning snuck in through the window  
We just laid there and listened to the waves come and go

I go wandering once again  
Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall the box of rags  
Someone gave us  
And how my mama put the rags to use  
There were rags of many colors  
Every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat  
And it was away down in the fall  
Mama sewed the rags together  
So in every piece with luck  
She made my coat of many colors  
That I was so proud of  
As she sewed, she told a story  
From the Bible she had read  
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore  
And then she said,  
Perhaps this coat  
Will bring you good luck and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it  
And my mama blessed it with a kiss  
My coat of many colors  
That my mama made for me  
Made only from rags  
That I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money  
Well, I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing  
And making fun of me  
In my coat of many colors  
My mama made for me  
And no, I couldn't understand it  
For I felt I was rich  
And I told them all the story  
Mama told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colors  
Was worth more than all their clothes  
But they didn't understand it  
And I tried to make them see  
""But one is only poor  
Only if he chooses to be.""  
Now I know we had no money

Made just for me

Be careful not to catch the scarlet fever.

The moves her body made while the music played  
Were the likes I've never seen  
And she became the envy of my dreams.  
One by one her teasing movements  
Brought the crowd out of their seats  
And all at once young scarlet  
Danced straight up in front of me

But she's a night club teaser  
Not paid to notice me  
Yes, I get scarlet fever  
If she knew how much I need her  
She'd place her hand in my hand  
And dance away with me.  
She looked 25 but I was told  
That she was just 16  
She had a way of making a man believe  
She danced for only him

And felt the sound of my heart beat  
And every night I'd dream  
She'd fall in love with me.  
Then one night while driving in  
My eyes begun to tear

Kirk Franklin,Let It Go,/k/kirk+franklin/let+it+go_20370443.html,"My mama gave me up when I was four years old  
She didn't destroy my body but she killed my soul  
Now it's cold 'cause I'm sleeping in my back seat  
Understand the spirit's willing but my flesh is weak  
Let me speak, I never had a chance to dream  
Ten years old finding love in dirty magazines  
Miss December you remember I bought you twice  
Now I'm thirty plus and still paying the price  
Had a sister that I barely knew  
Kind of got separated by the age of two  
Same mama different daddy so we couldn't fake it  
I saw my sister's daddy beat her in the tub naked  
Take it serious the demons in the man's mind  
The same daddy with rape charges now he's doing time  
Crack followed and like daddy prison thirteen years  
Haven't her but she's traded tears for fears  
  
Shout. Shout  
Let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
So come on  
I'm talking to you  
So come on  
  
Sex was how I made it through  
Without someone to teach you love what else is there to do?  
So where I'm from they call you gay and say you ain't a man  
Show them you ain't no punk  
Get all the girls you can  
A simple plan that still haunts me even now today  
Back to seventeen and got a baby on the way  
No G.E.D. all I see is failure in my eyes  
If you listening then remember I apologize  
I was raised falling in the church  
Made mistakes heard the Lord's calling in the church  
After service on the parking lot getting high  
Wanted to be accepted so bad I was willing to die  
Even tried to tell the pastor but he couldn't see  
Years of low self esteem and insecurities  
Church taught me how to shout and how to speak in tongues  
But preacher teach me how to live now when the tongue is done, help me  
  
See I'm. See I'm  
Soul surviver. Soul survivor  
World survivor  
I just wanna let it go  
World survivor, soul survivor  
Just wanna let it go  
  
Jesus please on my knees can't you hear my crying  
You said to put it in your hands and lord I'm really trying  
You wasn't lying when you said you'd reap what you sow  
Like that night mama died  
Hard to let it go  
You adopted me  
Cared for me  
And changed my name  
But I cursed at you  
Lied to you  
Left your pain  
It's not strange I can still see it in my head  
To know for hours you were laying in that bed  
If you listening to this record,  
If it's day our night  
If my mama still living treat your mama right  
Don't be like me and let that moment slip away  
And be careful cause you can't take back what you say  
To my real mama if you listening I'm letting it go  
To my father I forgive you 'cause you didn't know  
The pain was preparation for my destiny  
And one more thing lord let my son be a better man than me

Sorry for the sick and old

Sorry for the things I did

And walked away instead of  
Rubbing salt on all those open sores and wounds  
We should have left to heal

Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder  
You'd been to the station to meet every train  
And you came home without Lili Marlene  
  
And you treated my woman to a flake of your life  
And when she came back she was nobody's wife.  
  
Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth  
One more thin gypsy thief  
Well I see Jane's awake  
  
She sends her regards.  
And what can I tell you my brother, my killer  
What can I possibly say?

Money bags under my eyes, money over rest  
Tryna get 100 M's out the alphabets  
Open up my mouth to smile, oooh treasure chest  
Oooh, DJ Stevie J keep the Glock on him  
I just bought a new .44 and I'mma proud owner  
Belfast and Monroe that was our corner  
Fuckin' fast in your ho, oooh Kowa-bunga  
Sip some lean, pop a Xan bar  
My bougie bitch pussy taste like caviar  
Once I fuck a bitch, her pussy is a landmark  
I don't know how you like your steak but I'm in rare form  
Fuck them bitchass niggas, fuck whoever care for 'em  
Momma jumped out a plane, I was airborne  
Gold watches, gold chains, watch for Leprechauns  
Favorite subject was PE, Pablo Escobar  
Kill him when he least expect it at a restaurant  
Throw him with the rest of 'em in a reservoir  
I'm the renaissance man, peep my repertoire  
Excuse my french but it's menage a trois  
Oooh, my nina Ross got a bad mouth  
Yea, I'm consuming grass like a cash cow  
Give a fuck 'bout a police with his badge out  
If you ain't got a warrant get up out my damn house  
This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2  
This an all white affair, I brought the yay through  
She said Tunechi skate through, and I'mma skate you  
I'm aimin' at your grapefruit, blaow, grape juice  
Oooh, tell them bitches free dick and blow  
Give me head, can't kiss no more  
I got free jewelry, car keys, and more  
And I just thought of robbin' like a week ago  
Hundred diamonds on my bitch, I don't bling no more  
200,000 for a show, you gotta speak to Po  
Yeah, got me on my Young Money shit  
No Cash Money, just Young Money shit  
Woah, got me on my Young Money shit

Did your dreams die young, were they too hard won  
Did you reach too high and fall?  
And there is no rest for the ones God blessed  
And He blessed you best of all  
  
Your eyes seem from a different face  
They've seen that much that soon  
Your cheek's too cold, too pale to shine  
Like an old and waning moon  
  
And there is no peace, no true release  
No secret place to crawl  
And there is no rest for the ones God blessed  
And He blessed you best of all  
  
If tears unshed could heal your heart  
If words unsaid could sway  
Watch you melt into the night  
With adieu and rue the day  
  
Did your dreams die young, were they too hard won  
Did you reach too high and fall?  
And there is no rest for the ones God blessed

It was written on the walls and window shades  
And how she'd act a little girl  
A deceiver, don't believe her, that's her trade  
Sometimes a bottle of perfume  
Flowers and maybe some lace  
Men brought Louise ten cent trinkets  
Their intentions were easily traced  
Yes and everybody knew at times she cried  
Ah but women like Louise well they get by  
  
Yes and everybody thought it kinda sad  
When they found Louise in her room  
They'd always put her down below their kind  
Still some cried when she died this afternoon  
  
Louise rode home on the mail train  
Somewhere to the south I heard her say  
Too bad it ended so ugly  
Too bad she had to go this way  
  
Ah but the wind is blowing cold tonight  
Well goodnight Louise goodnight

And could ever ask for  
This is more than a crush  
Yeah  
  
It was Harlem at the ruckus  
I saw you with your man, a smiling, huh  
A coach bag in your hand  
I was laying in the coupe with my hat turned back  
We caught eyes for a moment and that was that  
  
So I skated off as you strolled off  
Looking at your legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)  
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission  
If his love is real he's got to handle competition  
You only knew him five months, (that's right)  
Besides he drinks too much, and smokes too many blunts  
  
And I'll be working out everyday thinkin' about you  
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view  
Catching flashbacks of our eye contact  
Wish I could lay you on your stomach and caress your back  
I would hold you in my arms and ease your fears  
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years

Hey lover, hey lover  
This is more than a crush, lover  
Hey lover, this is more than a crush

I see you at the bus stop waiting every day  
Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way  
And I don't want to violate your relationship  
So I'll lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip  
  
Still he can't stop me from having daydreams  
Tongue'n you down with uh, vanilla ice cream  
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight  
Searching you body with my tongue girl all night  
  
I wonder one day could it be, (how I wonder)  
Simple dreams could turn into reality  
Our love would come down so naturally  
We would walk down the aisle of destiny  
  
Would your man get his hustle on, got your type scared  
Break your off a little chump change to do your hair  
It seems to be enough to satisfy your needs  
But there's a deeper level if you follow our lead, hey lover  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Last week I saw ya at the mall  
Standing at the pay phone about to make a call  
I had a vision it was me on the other end  
Telling you come by and then you walked in  
  
I touched you gently with my hands  
We talked about traveling the distant lands  
Escaping all the madness out here in the world  
Becoming my wife no longer my girl  
  
Then you let your dress fall down to the floor (oh yeah)  
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more  
We experienced pleasure unparalleled  
Into an ocean of love we both fell  
  
Swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss  
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss  
Undying passion unites our souls  
Together we swim until the point of no control  
  
But, it's a fantasy, you won't come true  
We never even spoke and your man swears he love you  
So, I'm gonna keep all these feelings aside, (that's right)  
Keep my dreams alive until the right time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't nothing like a fantasy kid  
Words up  
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush  
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush  
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

I want my photographs back and my barcelino  
Keep the cartier babe I wouldn't give you the time of day  
Born a lady to the last perfumed stationery  
Does it make you feel good to make me feel ordinary?  
'Cause when I saw you I just knew  
I always would belong to you  
Goodbye baby, well you'll never see my smiling face  
Sweetheart, my complete heart's  
Trashed and bleeding with the sordid details in my suitcase  
Right on

Without any way to turn  
Tears are falling down like rain  
From the lessons that I have learned  
  
And I wish that I could fly away  
On the wings of a great golden bird  
To a place where there are no unhappy days  
And there are no unhappy words  
  
Yes, I wish that I could fly away  
To a land beyond this pain  
And lay my dreams on a mountain top  
And wash my mind in the rain  
  
Burned by the fire of an untrue love  
My heart is as cold as a stone  
And I know for sure that the road of life  
Is no place to travel alone  
  
And I wish that I could fly away  
To a land beyond this pain  
And lay my dreams on a mountain top  
And wash my mind in the rain  
  
Yes, I wish that I could fly away  
To a land beyond this pain  
And lay my dreams on a mountain top  
And wash my mind in the rain ?

High above us the evergreens  
Sparkle with lights and feel the breeze  
As we made future Christmas memories.

'Cause the mistletoe is occupied  
And the dream is to share  
This Christmas cheer with you all year  
And not wait till the morning  
When Christmas time is in the air again.

Warming up when he looks our way

Ev'ry time I got to thinking, where'd they disappear?  
When I woke up, Mom and Dad are rolling on the couch  
Rolling numbers, rock and rolling, got my Kiss records out  
  
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird  
Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay  
  
Away  
Away

Give love on christmas day (on christmas day)  
No greater gift is there than love

Men won't boys playin with bombs like kids play with toys  
One warm december our heart will see  
A world where men are free  
Someday at x'mas  
There'll be no wars when we have what x'mas is for  
When we have found what life's really worth  
There'll be peace on earth  
Someday at x'mas  
We'll see a land  
No hungry children no empty hand  
One happy morning People will share  
A world where people care  
  
I saw mommy kissing santa claus  
Underneath a mistle toe last night  
She didn't see me creep down the stairs to have a peep  
She tought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep  
Then I saw mommy tickle santa claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
Oh what a laugh it would have been if daddy had only seen  
Mommy kissing santa claus last night  
  
Come they told me parapapampam (rapapampam)  
A new born king to see parapapampam (rapapampam)  
Our finest gifts to bring parapapampam (rapapampam)  
To lay before the king parapapampam rapapampam rapapampam  
Soul to honor him parapapampam (rapapampam)

The good old days  
The triple o'shays when there was love

When I had you to myself  
I didn't want you around  
Those pretty faces  
Always made you  
Stand out in a crowd  
But someone picked you from the bunch  
When love was all it took  
Now it's much too late for me  
To take a second look  
  
Oh baby, give me one more chance  
(To show you that I love you)  
Won't you please let me

Trying to live without your love  
Is one long sleepless night  
Let me show you girl  
That I know wrong from right  
Every street you walk on  
I lay tear stains on the ground  
Following the girl  
I didn't even want you around  
  
Let me tell ya now  
Oh baby all I need is one more chance

Won't you please let me

We're the new family around here  
Guess that's all the reason some kids need  
'Cause they all call me names, and say I should just take it on the chin.  
  
If I'm overreacting, then why is it so cold here  
Why is it so cold here, in this hell

Asleep like stones in the well  
Empty as you leave your dry seashell  
  
Never seen you come this far  
Never thought I'd hope this hard

Haven't made a sound all week  
Tryin' to gather up some promises to keep  
I watched as the icicles fell  
Pinned to the bottom or drowning, it's hard to tell  
  
You may be human after all (I've never seen you come far)  
Must you build yourself so tall

Cover up the footprints I've been walkin' in

Far above their dreams and hopes  
And they a mountain city raised  
Where their queen above the clouds  
Could watch out.

indeed on a tv appearance as well. I have a version of Elvis Presly doing this

I wish I was a bluebird I'd never fly away  
I'd sit up on your shoulder baby and sing to you all day  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
I wrote it in a letter, carved it on a tree  
Told it to a honeycomb, told it to a bee  
Told them that I love you, they all know it's true  
Say it till the cows come home until it gets to you  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
Need you in the morning to start the coffee pot  
Need you in the afternoon to fan me when I'm hot  
Need you in the evening when supper time is through

Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy

You don't need them anymore.  
Your days are all through dying,  
They gave all their ghosts away,  
So kiss close all your wounds and call living life a day.  
For the planets gravitate around you,  
And the stars shower down around you,  
And the angels in heaven adore you,  
And the saints all stand and applaud you.  
So faraway,  
So faraway and yet so close.  
  
Say farewell to the passing of the years,  
Though all your sweet goodbyes will fall upon deaf ears.  
Kiss so softly the mouths of the ones you love,  
Beneath the September moon and the heavens above.  
And the world will turn without you,  
And history will soon forget about you,  
But the heavens they will reward you,  
And the saints will be there to escort you.  
So faraway,  
So faraway and yet so close.  
  
Do not grieve at the passing of mortality,  
For life's but a thing of terrible gravity.

And one of her brothers was a bad outlaw  
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Fud  
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud

The Tennessee stud was long and lean  
The color of the sun and his eyes were green  
A-He had the nerve and he had the blood  
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud  
  
We drifted on down into no man's land  
We crossed that river called the Rio Grande  
I raced my hoss with the Spaniard's foal  
Till I got me a skin full of silver and gold  
  
Me and the gambler we couldn't agree  
We got in a fight over Tennessee  
We jerked our guns, and he fell with a thud  
And I got away on the Tennessee stud

A-Dreaming of my girl in Tennessee  
The Tennessee stud's green eyes turned blue  
Cause he was a-dreamin' of his sweetheart, too  
  
We loped right back across Arkansas  
I whoop her brother and I whoop her pa

We crossed them mountains and the valleys wide  
We came into Big Muddy then we forded a flood

There's a pretty little baby on the cabin floor  
A little hoss colt playin' 'round the door

But I've been tired in my head.  
Well I am tired in my head.  
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.  
I got a lady running through my head.  
Ran out of money, looking for a night shift.  
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.  
My lady won't leave my head.  
I just want to rest my head to bed.  
She won't let me go.  
I don't want to go.

He cut his hair and bought new clothes in the cool city  
Finally found his life's ambition  
  
How to do nothing perfectly  
To do it with style so gracefully  
'Cause life is so delicious in Cool City

You open the door and check him out so casually  
The music's blasting all night long in cool city  
They recognize his face, so it's all right  
This one knew the right address

The girls who will be in movies

Shake some hands and take a lunch in cool city

We're called to keep on goin', pressin' on just to remain true

Cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house  
The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue  
And no way of expressing her feeling  
To her mam or anybody else in her life

Passenger,House On A Hill,/p/passenger/house+on+a+hill_20990660.html,"In an old house on a hillside  
Next to the sea  
Far from the madness, that folds around me  
Peaceful and gentle, like sails on the breeze  
  
In an old house on a hillside  
Next to the sea  
There's a warm light on a cold night  
And clean cotton sheets  
Soap smelling skin and tingling feet  
With stars lining the skyline  
And shine through the trees  
  
In an old house on a hillside  
Next to the sea  
And when the autumn comes down  
We'll get what we need from the town  
And all of our friends will be round  
  
In an old house on a hillside  
Next to the sea  
Moon white as paper and night like asleep  
With old things behind us and new things to be  
  
In an old house on a hillside  
Next to the sea  
And when the sunshine comes down,  
My hair will turn golden  
And my skin will turn brown  
And all of our friends will be round

Brushes your thigh

A conversation in a crowded room going nowhere

The street and I'll be thinking

Or is this some morbid little lie

A shadow in the family  
The baby waves bye-bye

Lose you as I lose my light

It wants soil as soft as summer  
And the strength to push like spring  
  
A broken laugh a broken fever  
Take it up with the great deceiver  
Who looks you in the eye  
And says baby don't cry  
Further to fly

Lose you as I lose my sight

Some guys were shooting pool  
And I heard the sound

Singing late in the evening  
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah  
  
Then I learned to play some lead guitar  
I was underage in this funky bar  
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a ""J""  
And when I come back to the room  
And everybody just seemed to move  
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play  
And it was late in the evening  
And I blew that room away!  
  
The first thing I remember  
When you came into my life  
I said ""I'm gonna get that girl  
No matter what I do""

Hey!... let's do it again an' again!  
If you will count up to ten,

Pet Shop Boys,So Sorry I Said (demo For Liza),/p/pet+shop+boys/so+sorry+i+said+demo+for+liza_20310115.html,"If this is a ghetto, I'm in it with you  
If it's just a prison, I'm locked in it too  
I tried to leave you, but after all that we had said  
I went to pieces when I should have shouted and screamed  
instead:  
So sorry, I said  
Your powers of persuasion, those quizzical eyes  
Have tired and tied me, with innocent guile  
I would have walked out, and after all the tears we shed  
I should have stalked out, gone and painted the town bright  
red  
But instead  
So sorry, I said  
How tough it gets, don't talk to me about it!  
To pay off your debts, I worked on overtime  
And you say you never believed in luck  
If you need a reason, consider me mad  
An old retainer, loyal and sad  
I bought my freedom, but after all that we had shared  
I couldn't leave you think of the skins I'd have to shed  
instead  
So sorry, I said  
So sorry, I said  
So sorry, I said

Nothing will ever be the same

I told you it was all a game  
Whenever I see you or your work  
It makes me feel like spitting  
What's that noise?  
Oh that, we've been expecting it for ages  
It's the sound of the atom splitting  
  
He's a villain, him over there with the stocking on his head  
Look, there's another, they call themselves ""pinheads""  
What's that noise over there?  
Is it corrugated iron they're hitting?  
No, no, it's perfectly normal  
It's just the sound of the atom splitting  
  
Whose side are you on anyway?  
Is that some kind of threat?  
Well, I suppose it'll have to do  
As long as you don't make too much mess  
And would the last person to leave  
Once you've all finished kissing  
Turn the video on to record  
You never know what you're missing  
Bread and circuses and maybe later  
The sound of the atom splitting  
  
Quiet at the back please! No hissing!  
It's the sound, the sound  
The sound of the atom splitting  
  
I hate you! I hate you!  
Quiet at the back please! No hissing!

I don't wanna play rough I've been loving you enough  
Oh, baby

Touch my lips, I'm on fire  
You're the only one I'll ever desire  
Turn the lights down low, make the world go slow  
When I'm holding you tonight it's so easy  
Nothing moves me like you do when you tease me  
And to rush would be a crime  
I just wanna spend some time with you baby  
Chorus  
And when I'm here beside you  
I wanna see what drives you out of your mind  
I never wanna leave I only wanna be with you  
'cause I love how you feel your love is so real  
I wanna take forever tonight  
Wanna stay in this moment forever  
I'm gonna give you all the love that I've got

Oeffnen Haende weit  
Wenn die Sonne kommt

Der Staub bedeckt mich ganz  
Und langsam dringt es ein  
Und ich - ich lass - es zu  
  
Schlag das Radio -  
Keine Stimme mehr von draussen  
Schlag die Uhr -  
Den Tag nicht in Stuecke reissen  
Schlag die Kamera -

All the walls close in on me  
Pressure's building wave on wave  
Till the water breaks - and outside I go, oh  
  
One dot, that's on or off, defines what is and what is not, one dot  
Two dot, a pair of eyes, a voice, a touch, complete surprise, two dot  
Growing up, growing up,  
Looking for a place to live

Four dot, is what will make a square, a bed to build on, it's all there,  
Four dot

My ghost likes to travel so deep into your space  
  
All the slow clouds pass us by  
Make the Empire State look high  
As you take me in your sea-stained sweetness  
It spills, it tingles and it stings  
All the pleasure that it brings  
'Til the door has let the outside inside here  
  
Well on the floor there's a long wooden table  
On the table there's an open book  
On the page there's a detailed drawing  
And on the drawing is the name I took

The breathing stops, I don't know when  
In transition once again  
Such a struggle getting through these changes  
And it all seems so absurd  
To be flying like a bird  
When I do not feel I've really landed here.

I got lost, couldn't find my way  
And I guess there's nothing more to say  
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange  
But I'm here and here I will stay  
  
So everyday I cry  
Yes everyday I fall  
Do you ever wonder why, why I love everything about you  
  
But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still  
'til then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will  
  
It picked me up, knocked me off my feet  
I've got no way to explain  
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside  
Will never see the light of day  
  
So everyday goes by  
And everyday I fall  
It makes me wonder why,  
My life's worth nothing without you  
  
But everyday I say I'll try  
To make my heart be still  
Cause every way there is to cry,  
Ourselves to sleep, we will  
  
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no  
You'll never know just how close we were  
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no  
You'll never know  
No you'll never see  
  
The book closes and we try to forget  
But I know that things won't change  
How we feel, how life goes on  
And that seems so strange  
  
And so the light fades away  
Try, try, try as I may  
I can't stop thinking about you  
It seems my life's worth nothing without you  
  
But everyday I say I'll try  
To make my heart be still  
'til then every way there is to cry,  
Ourselves to sleep, we will

Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

Shiny smooth streams and unclimbable cliffs

As if by some signal that's unheard by me  
  
I stand on a featureless sheet of blue stone  
And for one instant I'm not quite alone  
Your hand is extended but then you rescin  
And you like my thoughts are borne off by the wind  
  
And here I maneuver in doubtful terrain  
Wondering which of my feelings remain  
Have I even met you, or is that still ahead?  
What I had hoped might linger is swept off instead

Jumping to my feet  
I try to put myself together

Caught in a world of selfish cares

My eyes were opened, now I will never

In the misty morning light  
Held a match to your cigarette  
Watched the smoke curl in the mist  
Your eyes, blue as the ocean between us  
Smiling at me  
  
I awoke alone and lonely  
In a faraway place  
The sun fell cold upon my face  
The cracks in the ceiling spelt hell  
Turned to the wall  
Pulled the sheets around my head  
Tried to sleep, and dream my way  
Back to you again  
  
Count the days  
Slowly passing by  
Step on a plane  
And fly away

As the dawn birds sing  
On a cold and misty morning

Son you're gonna pay for what you've done  
But I don't give a damn  
  
Just cause I like to drink and dance all night  
An alley cat brawl in an old fist fight

Watch you head fly north and your teeth fly south

Even when we sleep  
For some small protection

Love is hard to define  
It runs in circles  
Round the mind  
But a circle  
Ain't a circle  
If it's not complete  
  
Oh love me from the heart down  
If it hurts or if it's bliss  
Love me from the heart down  
Reveal me with a kiss

With a brain that let's me down  
Down...down

But the hunger still remains  
You sink into my flesh like a knife  
When day comes to an end  
We take off all our clothes  
And stand naked face to face  
With real life

Get me on the floor  
Love me from the heart down

Gives love the run around, around

Smiles are deceiving

him up and then,

friend. His name is Harold""

Schooly D.  
Harold he's a friendly guy, he rambles on and on, he'll talk the balls off a
rhinosaurus.  
Fact is he just doesn't make much sense, well Stan said "" This guys pretty

up like an old christmas tree.""  
""Het bro you know Id like to thank you once again for letting me hang with

That's the last I seen of Harold.

Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to  
Let it be known, I told you  
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)  
Waiting for love like this too long  
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)  
All that you need I can give you  
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)

I'm the light when you can't see  
I'm that air when you can't breathe  
I'm that feeling when you can't leave  
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive  
So it's only you and me  
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong  
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong  
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected  
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected  
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare  
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared  
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you  
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you  
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil  
Make love all night, bending bed coils  
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal  
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you  
Repeat 1 until fade

the spreaker. Hit it Mark, 45 king  
I am a bill, yes I'm only a bill when  
It's time to ill I get ill and time to chill  
I chill, my homeboy said this was the D.A.I.S.Y. age  
I take it as meaning you have to get crazy paid  
You hope I'm from your borough, because I'm thorough  
You want me to be down with you, to be seen walking around with you  
Go to the store and buy a brew and rock a rhyme or two  
So you can bite it, you taste it, you like it  
You think I'm sleeping on you? Please, don't even try it  
The name is Latifah, the scene, it is mine  
The 45 King keeps the beat and the time while I  
Rock to the rhythm and keep it blowing out  
So don't try to turn me inside out  
Latifah is the name you love  
Flying through rhymes like a dove  
Slapping suckers with a glove  
Challenge me and you will burn  
Yes in the fire you will burn  
It's so so simply done  
When I find that I have to run  
Lyrics to music by the King of Swing, The 45 King  
The words we bring I write, and sing  
Cause I am Latifah, the Queen of course  
Don't try to get yours off, because the cause is lost  
Mark conducts the beat, I watch it hit them  
Won't you chill? I don't need another victim  
To add to the list of aggrivation  
Subtracting suckers like a math computation  
We are not teaching pupils and subjects with no scruples  
This is a King and Queen creation  
So hello hello hello and how ya doing?  
Forget the smalltalk now, it's time for me to ruin  
Those who don't believe in what I'm saying  
When I put up the wall of words ain't no way into my Queendom  
Controlled by me, the heir to the throne is the Ruler Lord Ramsey  
The Ruler Lord, to him there is no equal  
He grabs it and starts bombing people  
Don't listen to me to figure me out  
Because you can't turn my mind inside out  
Latifah is the name you love  
Flying through rhymes like a dove  
Slapping suckers with a glove  
Challenge me and you will burn  
Yes in the fire you will burn  
Rhyming's not a question of one superiority  
But rather how you delegate the use of your authority  
I know who you are, and I know who you are to me  
But I came here just to party  
If it's a show you want, the show it live  
And if it's trouble you seek, I have arrived  
When Mark requests my approval, I nod  
And after each and every single rhyme I thank God  
although a taste of my body would soothe you  
I give you just my voice and watch the rhythm move you  
The method of my lyrics makes the funky people feel it  
And Lord have mercy on those that try to steal it  
Latifah is a name meaning ""delicate and sensitive""  
But I have no problem formulating sentences  
To break you down to the ground  
I won't use violence, the color of this is brown  
And I am down, but never ever down and out  
So don't try to turn me inside out  
Latifah is the name you love  
Flying through rhymes like a dove  
Slapping suckers with a glove  
Challenge me and you will burn  
Yes in the fire you will burn  
Jah know? Cause ah...  
Music, 45 King, music Latifah the Queen  
Music, domination to bring the world

There between snails, a lonely animal  
During the day I run after the night  
You escape me for the second time  
Marry me  
with my hands I dig deep  
To find what I missed so much  
And under the moon in its most beautiful dress  
I have kissed your cold mouth  
I take you tenderly by the arm  
But your skin rips like paper  
And parts fall off of you

I searched my heart and mind

What came over me that night  
As a love began to grow  
That would last for all time  
And you said,  
I can see it in your eyes

Than words could ever hold  
We could wait a thousand lifetimes  
And never feel like this again

I can see it in your eyes  
Later on I asked your hand  
And I prayed the time was right  
I knelt down on one knee  
And said would you be my bride?  
And the sound of silence  
Filled the air  
As your tears fell with mine  
You didn't have to say a word  
For me to realize  
And I said,  
I can see it in your eyes  
They're the windows to your soul  
I see dreams come alive  
And future plans unfold  
I could wait a thousand lifetimes  
And not find a perfect love again  
But when you look at me that way  
I can see it in your eyes

And what a life we've made  
How again we search for words  
As the heart inside me breaks  
Until death do we part  
Were the vows we made  
And now the time has come  
But goodbye is so hard to say

Bring a light into the darkness

On the cross at Calvary

Voices rang and Angels sang  
Dancing 'round the tomb

My talking dolphin spoke to me  
He spoke to me in symphony  
From freedom's peace beneath the sea  
He looked to me eyes full of love  
Said yes we live behind the sun  
  
Behind the sun  
  
The sun goes up  
And the sun gets down  
But like the heart of the sun  
My heart continues to pound  
  
Now while I shower in the rain  
I watch my dolphin swim away  
The one who listens to the surf  
Can feel the pulse beat of the earth  
And like my dolphin swims so free  
The sun does swim into the sea  
  
Behind the sun  
  
An island flying through the sky  
One day your son might ask you why  
And if you son should be a girl  
She too might ask you of this world  
The sun shines sweet upon your beach  
And yes my dolphin loves to teach  
  
Behind the sun  
  
The sun goes up  
And the sun gets down  
But like the heart of the sun  
My heart continues to pound

The family posed, led by Louise  
Like right out of some kind of Rockwell scene  
But Jake couldn't fake it anymore  
Nobody heard the hammer fallin'  
Sensed that judgment day was callin'  
Nobody thought to fear the boy next door  
Everybody loves to point their finger  
They might as well have pulled the trigger  
Nobody stopped to hear the boy next door  
Willy later said, ""He really should've known  
The boy spent too much time on his own  
And what was on his mind, God only knew""  
One by one the neighbors went away  
A gruesome little game Jake taught himself to play  
His daddy always said, ""Find something to do""  
Nobody heard the hammer fallin'  
Sensed that judgment day was callin'  
Nobody thought to fear the boy next door

They might as well have pulled the trigger  
Nobody stopped to hear the boy next door  
One less mistake to think about  
'Cause no one read the writing on the wall  
So much for case 1239  
Covered up, curled up in a ball  
One little page in the history of crime  
Lawyers made a fortune for their time  
Seems an explanation was never found  
And I hope this tale won't be misunderstood  
Things ain't the same in every neighborhood  
But before you go to sleep tonight, look around  
Nobody heard the hammer fallin'  
Sensed that judgment day was callin'  
Nobody thought to fear the boy next door

You don't have to be so afraid  
Couse I got room up on my team  
You can play but hold up.  
  
It's just the way the game is played  
It's best if you just wait your turn.  
  
It's getting crowded over here...  
But babe... The wait is ova!  
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win  
The wait is ova  
  
Fumble don't't you fumble  
That's a flag on the play  
Babe if you don't wanna  
Then you don't have to wait  
  
But together we gon'be taking over  
It's just the way the game is played  
It's best if you just wait your turn.  
  
So you don't wanna wait  
I hate to hear-That's such a shame  
Couse if you playing tight wears and no  
Diamond in my ears  
Then you already under way...  
I know you want to win and you wish I would let you in  
Get in line over here  
You can play but hold up  
  
It's just the way the game is played  
It's best if you just wait your turn.  
  
It's getting crowded over here...  
But babe... The wait is ova!  
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win  
The wait is ova

That's a flag on the play  
Babe if you don't wanna  
Then you don't have to wait  
But together we gon'be taking over  
  
It's just the way the game is played  
It's best if you just wait your turn.  
  
Baby put the work in like a champion  
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up  
Couldn't be with no one else  
You're the only way... I win!  
  
Baby got the whole world standing up  
Damn I bet a pitcher took a chance on love  
Baby love... The time is now  
And now-The wait is ova!  
  
The wait is ova (4x)  
Just wait your turn  
The wait is ova (4x)  
Just wait your turn

I'm very excited to be here  
Yet again, it's an honor to be nominated  
Bla bla bla bla  
  
Well that Brits night was so fucking boring  
Past the days of yes, yes, Charlene  
Coke in the box til 7 in the morning  
Look the wrong way and we end up brawling  
When I had a bit of beef with you know who  
And I fucked a few female stars or two  
Nearly everything I said I'd end getting screwed  
Spitting at the... looking rude in the news  
Oh yes, you're still rocking with the best!  
Second person on my year to have touched a breast  
I'm nearly 40 now and I'm still impressed  
Here's the midlife crisis I guess.  
Oh I recall, taking in the wonder of it all  
  
Chorus:  
I'm still looking for an answer through the looking glass  
Still not concentrating at the back of the class  
No thanks sir, this one's for you!  
It's like a VD clinic, only pricks are in it  
So fucking corporate and professional and timid  
To be frank sir, I prefer this showbiz chancer!  
I still want to get laid by you right!  
  
Now I know I've got fat but make no mistake  
Every million that I make they bake me a cake  
So I've got plenty, 120  
Wearing rows of tweed like the...  
I still want to get you naked  
I'll see you in the summer, so glad you could make it!  
I'll be that mega white thing, fast as lightening  
In... shape, but twice as frightening.  
If they can't be bothered, then I promise you this  
If they won't entertain you then I'll do my fucking best!  
  
Chorus:  
I'm still looking for an answer through the looking glass  
Still not concentrating at the back of the class  
No thanks sir, this one's for you!

So fucking corporate and professional and timid  
To be frank sir, I prefer this showbiz chancer!  
I still want to get laid by you!  
  
Would you let me lay you down right here?  
Would you let me live?

Often, I don't see it when I've been wrong,  
And boy have I been wrong  
Often, I wont need it 'till it's gone,  
But by then it's gone  
  
Often, I make the worst decisions  
Say that it's great when I know it isn't, so  
It's happening so....  
Often  
  
Often, I won't wake up from a dream,  
You know I love to dream  
Often, I don't stand up for what I believe,  
There's nothing left to believe  
  
So often, I make the worst decisions,  
Say that it's great when I know it isn't, so  
It's happening so.... Often  
  
I often wish that you were here,  
I could moan and bend your ear  
  
Do Doo Do Doo Do Doo Do  
Yeah, Yeah  
  
Often, I don't see it when I've been wrong,  
And boy have I been wrong

Robbie Williams,Something Beautiful,/r/robbie+williams/something+beautiful_20116751.html,"You can't manufacture a miracle  
The silence was pitiful that day.  
A love is getting too cynical  
Passion's just physical these days  
You analyze everyone you meet  
But get no sign, love ain't kind  
Every night you admit defeat  
And cry yourself blind  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you can't wake up in the morning  
Cause your bed lies vacant at night  
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely  
Can't control it, try as you might  
May you find that love that won't leave you  
May you find it by the end of the day  
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely  
Something beautiful will come your way  
  
The DJ said on the radio  
Life should be stereo, each day  
In the past you cast the unsuitable  
Instead of some kind of beautiful, you just couldn't wait  
All your friends think you're satisfied  
But they can't see your soul no, no, no  
Forgot the time feeling petrified, when they lived alone  
  
[Chorus  
  
Some kind of beautiful (will come your way) [Repeat: x4]  
  
All your friends think you're satisfied  
But they can't see your soul no no no  
Forgot the time feeling petrified  
When they lived alone

Never wrecked my head on a bandstand

Wear a skirt be a flirt if I want

You gotta get it while you can

Don't play the blues down in old Toulouse for me  
Let sleighbells ring and children sing in the street

But you left me alone  
You can't put your arms around what's already gone  
Watch you sink like a stone  
You can't put your arms around what's already gone  
  
Well, you hurt to the core  
You used to kiss like no one had done before  
And your taste turned me on  
Now you drive me real crazy just by being born  
  
'Cause you left (left, left, left) me alone (left me alone)  
And you can't put your arms around what's already gone  
Watch you sink like a stone  
You can't put your arms around what's already gone

Took the tram 'round the bay  
Where everyone tells you to have a nice day  
And my pride almost broke  
When the tears don't fit you, you look like a joke  
  
And you left (left, left, left) me alone (left me alone)  
You can't put your arms around what's already gone  
Cryin' eyes gettin' worn  
You can't put your arms around what's already gone

Happy days you pretend  
That your love will never end

Where it's coming from I must have been  
Drifting out of time, now I'm in  
Underneath you'll find I'm just the same  
Running wild, like you do  
When all your dreams fall through

That I'll fall in love again

If only dreams came true  
I could even pretend  
That I'll fall in love again

Kicking up dust and I don't give a god damn!

Filthy large, Rage in charge

Puffin stuff, hey yo Snoop, you're up  
Let these niggas know that niggas don't give a fuck!  
  
This is just a small introduction to the G Funk Era  
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror  
And I see motherfuckers trying to be like me  
Every since I put it down with the D-are-E  
  
Foaming at the mouth and wagging his tail  
Searching through the yards with a keen sense of smell  
Looking for the business in heat  
And when he find it he'll be sniffing her seat  
We travel in packs and we do it from the back  
How else can you get to the booty?  
We do it Doggystyle, all the while we do it Doggystyle  
Yo motherfucking hoes  
He fucked the fleas off a bitch  
He shacked the ticks off his dick  
And in the booty, he buries his motherfucking bone  
And if there's any left over  
He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home  
  
Damn, that Tanqueray is talking to a nigga  
I ain't bullshitting, one of y'all niggas gotta get it  
Man I got ta piss

When a voice behind me asked  
""Stranger how have you been?""  
I was caught off guard when I saw her face  
Stumbled my way through an awkward embrace  
Yet somehow I managed to say ""good to see you again""  
We caught up on old friends  
Caught up on old times  
But all through the small talk, it kept burning through my mind  
  
Does she think about the nights we spent on crystal lake  
Wrapped up in a blanket 'til the break of day  
So many times I wondered does she think of me that way  
I didn't ask and she didn't say  
  
Trading stories and pictures of kids  
Things we're gonna do and things never did  
'Til we were stranded in that moment not sure what to say  
Then she broke the silence with her little shy smile  
And she brought up the weather but all the while  
  
I wondered if she thinks about Jackson hole  
Nights beside the fire and angels in the snow  
So many times I've wondered does she think of me that way  
  
I didn't ask and she didn't say  
We said our goodbyes, swore we'd stay in touch  
Then we went our separate ways knowing, knowing no one ever does

Our guilt, our blame,  
I've been far too sympathetic.  
Our blood, our fault.  
I've been far too sympathetic.  
I am not innocent.  
You are not innocent.  
No one is innocent.  
I will no longer tolerate you  
Even if I must go down beside you.  
Because, no one is innocent.

Tori Amos,After All,/t/tori+amos/after+all_20202303.html,"Please trip them gently  
They don't like to fall  
Oh by jingo  
There's no room for anger  
We're all very small  
Oh by jingo  
  
We're painting our faces  
And dressing in thoughts from the skies  
From paradise  
They think that we're holding a secretive ball  
Won't someone invite them  
They're just taller children, that's all  
After all  
  
Man is an obstacle  
Sad as a clown  
Oh by jingo  
So hold on to nothing  
And he won't let you down  
Oh by jingo  
  
Some people are marching together  
And some on their own  
Quite alone  
Others are running  
The smaller ones crawl  
But some sit in silence  
They're just older children that's all  
After all  
  
I sing with impertinence  
Shading impermanent chords  
With my words  
I've borrowed your time  
And I'm sorry I called  
But the thought just occurred  
That we're nobody's children at all,  
After all  
  
Live till your rebirth  
And do what you will  
Oh by jingo  
Forget all I've said  
Please bear me no ill  
Oh by jingo  
  
After all

Toto,Mindfields,/t/toto/mindfields_20139746.html,"There's a rumor of a midnight man  
So silent in disguise  
And every time he looks your way  
You see it in his eyes  
Like a window to the storm  
He just invades your paradise  
Don't you buy what he is selling  
It's just lies  
  
When he says, these hearts are willing  
Story goes, these dreams are free  
  
Only takes a moment  
But you must acclimatize  
Don't you buy what he is selling  
It's just lies  
  
Over your left shoulder I have seen the angry beast  
Heard the war horn screaming, as they gather for the feast  
Seen a star-crossed angel with the death-card and a shield  
  
We're walking through mindfields  
You see an angel and she takes you by the hand  
We're walking through mindfields  
Her lips are moving like she's praying  
We're walking through mindfields  
She speaks so softly and you want to understand  
What she's saying  
  
There's a stairway leading to the sun  
I walk it in my sleep  
And a ship of fools above the sky  
Who've gotten into deep  
With a doorway into nowhere  
And the path is way too steep  
Don't lose your angry soul  
It's yours to keep  
  
Where it ends, it's the beginning  
And it stays, right to the end  
  
The reason is unclear my friend  
It almost makes me weep  
So don't lose your angry soul  
It's yours to keep

Tracy Chapman,Broken,/t/tracy+chapman/broken_20159754.html,"You can close your eyes  
And see a picture perfect life  
Inside of your mind  
Dreaming only of the days ahead  
Wanted and wished for more than now  
Or the days behind  
You waste your time  
  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
  
You can never think  
You can't even stop yourself  
Before the words have been spoken  
And you've already said  
You would give everything  
And something for nothing  
Everybody thinks you're joking  
  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
  
You want to be the one  
Made over be your own  
Before and after  
And a supermarket  
Beauty in a bottle queen  
Who'll one day grace a check-out counter  
Magazine front cover  
Though the fine print reads  
  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
  
Lets it be broken  
Lets it be broken  
Lets it be broken  
Lets it be broken  
Lets it be broken  
Broken  
Broken  
  
When your life is never what you wanted  
Not even halfway normal  
Just tarnished and soiled  
When in your reach  
A framed and frozen moment  
So far from perfection  
Not truth or transcendence  
Will set you free  
Still you don't believe  
  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broken  
The picture makes a promise  
The flesh lets it be broke

Tracy Chapman,Matters Of The Heart,/t/tracy+chapman/matters+of+the+heart_20140249.html,"I lose my head

I make a fool of myself  
In matters of the heart  
We should have been holding each other  
Instead we talked  
I make a fool of myself  
In matters of the heart  
  
But I asked before  
Your reply was kind and polite  
One wants more  
When one's denied  
I make a fool of myself  
In matters of the heart  
  
I won't call it love  
But it feels good to have passion in my life  
If there's a battle  
I hope my head always defers to my heart  
In matters of the heart  
  
I guess I'm crazy to think  
I can give you what you don't want  
I make a fool of myself  
In matters of the heart  
  
I wish that I had the power  
To make these feelings stop  
I lose all self control  
In matters of the heart  
  
I can't believe  
It's so hard to find someone  
To give affection to  
And from whom you can receive  
I guess it's just the draw of the cards  
In matters of the heart  
  
You caught me off guard  
Somehow you reached me  
Where I thought I had nothing left inside  
I've learned my lesson I've been edified  
In matters of the heart  
  
I've spent my nights  
Where the sleeping dogs lie  
Not by your side  
It feels so lonely  
Once again I've left to much to chance  
In matters of the heart  
  
Here I sit  
I'm feeling sorry for myself  
It's quite a sight  
But I have you to thank  
For reminding me  
We're all alone in this world  
And in matters of the heart  
  
I'm already missing you  
Although we won't say good byes  
Until tomorrow afternoon  
Maybe when and if I see you again  
We'll see eye to eye  
In matters of the heart  
  
I have no harsh words for you  
I have no tears to cry  
If the moon were full  
I'd be howling inside  
It only hurts  
In matters of the heart  
  
If today were my birthday  
I'd be reborn  
As bronte's bird a bird that could fly  
And all accounts would be settled  
In matters of the heart  
  
Matters of the heart

On this madness end this confusion  
But we've all heard the privileged boast and preach  
And the promised land we want is still out of reach  
  
I once knew a man who wore self-righteousness  
Like a medal on his inflated chest  
He hated all people for breaking his rules  
Looked down with distaste on the cowards and fools  
  
He lived like a king in his castle of stone  
And sneered at the man who worked hard for his home  
He knew all the right words and who to defend  
And would be with conviction the working mans friend

Like they said I would end up  
  
The youth is marching to tear us down  
We built our lives here  
We fight their calling  
  
Take sides  
Line up and take sides  
  
I'm so sick of you calling the shots (I'll tear you down from the inside)  
  
I can't find the light  
Inside this empty room I seem to loose myself  
I won't let you down  
  
So write this down  
I'm not using my lungs anymore  
This is the last time  
Write it down  
I won't be your voice anymore

Streets paved with gold  
Night gives out a warning  
There's thunder in her heart  
And mother wolf is calling  
  
Searchin' in the shadows

She cries out a prayer  
Like a song from beyond the grave

While she alone will  
Walk the streets tonight

All the streets washed with rain

Eyes burnt with pain  
  
Returning to the twilight  
Betrayed by the night

Everyday it's the same old situation  
I face the same old line of empty faces  
Sit at my desk while the clock counts up my wages  
  
Pick up my pay every Friday and take off like a  
Shot in the dark  
I took off like a shot in the dark  
I split the scene like a shot in the dark  
  
Ain't got no target, don't aim for no mark  
'Cause I'm off like a shot in the dark  
It was only a game when we first started  
The novelty wore away and the fun departed  
  
I can't live up anymore to those things I spouted  
And if you say you feel the same way  
I'll be off like a  
Shot in the dark  
  
There's no changes going down  
There's no lesson to be found  
Makes no sense to hang around  
If that's all there is to that  
  
(That's what she said)  
Someone just tossed a bomb through  
Kitchen window  
And in the middle of a shoo-fly pie  
  
Mama took off like a  
Bat out of hell  
She took off like a shot in the dark

Hands are full of a fishin' rod  
And the tackle on our backs  
We just stood there gettin' wet  
With our backs against the fence  
  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Hope it don't rain all day

Stoned me just like Jelly Roll  
And it stoned me  
And it stoned me to my soul  
Stoned me just like goin' home  
And it stoned me  
  
Then the rain let up and the sun came up  
And we were gettin' dry  
Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by  
So we jumped right in and the driver grinned  
  
And he dropped us up the road  
We looked at the swim and we jumped right in  
Not to mention fishing poles  
  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Let it run all over me

On the way back home we sang a song  
But our throats were getting dry  
Then we saw the man from across the road  
With the sunshine in his eyes  
  
Well he lived all alone in his own little home  
With a great big gallon jar  
There were bottles too, one for me and you  
And he said Hey! There you are  
  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Oh, the water  
Get it myself from the mountain stream

With a rabid wolverine in my underwear  
When suddenly a guy behind me in the back seat  
Popped right up and cupped his hands across my eyes  
I guessed, ""Is it Uncle Frank or Cousin Louie?  
Is it Bob or Joe or Walter?  
Could it be Bill or Jim or Ed or Bernie or Steve?""  
I probably would have kept on guessing  
But about that time we crashed into the truck  
And as I'm laying bleeding there on the asphalt  
Finally I recognize the face of my hibachi dealer  
Who takes off his prosthetic lips and tells me  
Everything you know is wrong  
Black is white, up is down and short is long  
And everything you thought was just so important doesn't matter  
Everything you know is wrong  
Just forget the words and sing along  
All you need to understand is  
Everything you know is wrong  
  
I was walkin' to the kitchen for some Golden Grahams  
When I accidentally stepped into a alternate dimension  
And soon I was abducted by some aliens from space  
Who kinda looked like Jamie Farr  
They sucked out my internal organs  
And they took some Polaroids and said I was a darn good sport  
And as a way of saying thank you  
They offered to transport me back to any point in history that I would care to
go  
And so I had them send me back to last Thursday night  
So I could pay my phone bill on time  
Just then the disembodied head of Colonel Sanders started yelling  
  
Everything you know is wrong  
Black is white, up is down and short is long  
And everything you thought was just so important doesn't matter  
Everything you know is wrong  
Just forget the words and sing along  
All you need to understand is  
Everything you know is wrong  
  
I was just about to mail a letter to my evil twin  
When I got a nasty paper cut  
And, well, to make a long story short  
It got infected and I died  
So now I'm up in heaven with St. Peter by the pearly gates  
And it's obvious he doesn't like the Nehru jacket that I'm wearing  
He tells me that they've got a dress code  
Well, he lets me into heaven anyway  
But I get the room next to the noisy ice machine for all eternity  
And every day he runs by screaming  
  
Everything you know is wrong  
Black is white, up is down and short is long  
And everything you thought was just so important doesn't matter  
Everything you know is wrong  
Just forget the words and sing along  
All you need to understand is

Why don't we, why don't we,

Honest and sweet surrender -  
Never wanted this illusion  
In our lives.  
Trials and tribulations,  
Familiar conversations,  
In our lives, in our lives.  
Competing against everyone,  
A trap, that, and a snare.  
Return to nature, no solution, so beware!  
How can it be this way?  
Shouldn't be so.  
Surviving day after day,  
Unwilling to let go.

Why don't we, why don't we,  
Open our eyes?  
Livin' with a global village,  
Aware of the unexpected  
In our lives.  
Transforming greed and pillage,  
Not to be rejected -  
It's our lives, it's our lives!  
Changes are vital, do we care?  
It's taken far too long - maybe we're there?  
Stop workin' with our time, if you dare.  
There is a rightness, yes, everywhere.  
Why don't we, why don't we,  
Open our eyes?  
Why don't we, why don't we,  
Share this time?  
Why don't we, why don't we,

So vast this heavy load  
With a touch of luck and a sense of need  
Seeing the guns and their faces  
We look around the open shore  
Waiting for something

With the steel guitar and the love you give me  
Underneath the skin a feeling, a breakdown  
Well we sat for hours on the crimson sand  
  
Exchanges in the currency of humans bought and sold  
And the leaders seem to lose control  
  
Shall we lose ourselves for a reason  
Shall we burn ourselves for the answer  
Have we found the place that we're looking for  
Someone shouted ""open the door""  
Lookout

Aim high shoot low

Break high let go  
Shoot high aim low

Shoot high let go  
Who says there's got to be an answer

Shoot high let go  
Shoot high aim low

Fuck we're on the same side  
Knowing if I stumble  
Aware if I fall  
I don't need finger pointed at me  
If you're not trying at all  
Not trying to come off righteous  
Just always tried to be sincere  
Didn't mean to come off so well-learned  
Cause I'm just another peer

I know how it felt  
And I don't have to prove it to anybody  
Because I already proved it to myself  
No matter where I am in this world

And ride on to Peru

If she won't I'll move on anyhow

So little time,  
Santa won't be coming around my house this year,  
Cause I tried to drown my sister and I pierced my ear,  
Oh mama made it perfectly clear,  
Santa don't like bad boys... Especially jewish ones.  
  
Gnip-gnop and lego blocks are all that I desire,  
So why did I have to set the pizza guy's hair on fire,  
I told him I was sorry,  
I'm a liar,  
So no toys for me... I don't deserve them.  
  
I couldn't wait for a big wheel as the holiday neared,  
But then I told my grandma that she had a beard.  
  
Dear santa,  
  
I know what my problem is, why I can't be good, it's a fear of intimacy.  
You see my whole life whenever I've met someone really great like you and  
I keep feeling like I'm getting close to them, something inside me makes  
Me want to screw it up. So in a weird way the reason I'm so bad is because  
I love you santa.  
  
Rock-em sock-em robots is what I was hoping for,  
But then I made a death threat to vice president gore,  
Oh santa won't be knocking on my door,  
Cause he's a big fat whore... What made me say that?  
  
Chutes and ladders would be so good indeed,  
So why'd I have to sell that cop a bag of weed,  
So santa please give me that easy bake oven,  
I swear I thought billy goats we're made for lovin'.  
  
So santa won't you accept my apologies,  
Santa can't you see I'm begging you please,  
Oh santa next year I'll do you right,

I can't believe I found a love that's so pure and true.

It was a goddamn joke.  
And when I think of you and I,  
I hope you fucking choke.  
  
I hope you're glad with what you've done to me.

She came out with a lion's roar  
Yelling, ""I'm going to the corner store,  
Be back at quarter to four""  
""Don't slam your pinkies in the drawer""  
She can be like a maiden from the days of yore  
Hanging out at Studio 54  
Break dancing on the slick brick disco floor  
With Lionel Richie  
Who, by the way, was a Commodore  
One time she gave mouth-to-mouth to a snaggle tooth boar  
Who couldn't breat right since the Vietnam War  
Then she played Chinese Checkers with Skeletor  
And went camping with Eva Gabor  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
And she's coming home  
I got a picture of her down by the seashore  
Wearing a bikini made of purple velour  
Her hair's up like Conway Twitty's pompadour  
With the smile of Guy Lefleur  
She got the ups and downs like an elevator  
But deep inside she's a marshmellow smore  
Can bake a cake as big as Jupitor  
Either or, Neithor nor  
She'll share it with your Labrador  
She can run faster than a blazing meteor  
Loves Winnie the Pooh and his friend Eeyore  
Can make a pipe out of an apple core  
That's a trick she learned from Roberto Parrish  
Down in Ecuador  
You know why?  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
And she's coming home  
Well, for sure she opened the door  
Whipped out a 3-ft fishing lure  
Sexually, that made me insecure  
Like the time I was a roadie  
On Elton John's tour  
She said, ""Let's go catch some Piscatore!""  
I said, ""Beatrice, you don't eat fish no more.""  
She said, ""By God, you're right!""  
So we took ourselves a snore  
And when we woke up 10 hours later  
We made Love Du Jour  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
And she came home  
She likes to clean out the attic every now and then  
She's gonna knit me a brand new golfing bag  
We gonna watch ourselves a John Wayne movie  
Then we gonna free all the doggies at the kennel  
She gonna try on my third grade mittens  
She'll keep 'em on even though they're way too small  
Well, she ain't never gonna hurt me  
She ain't never gonna let me down  
She ain't never gonna tell nobody  
I'm afraid of birds and spiders  
Well, Bea-bea-bea-beatrice  
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice

When I felt the need  
For a life of my own  
I dreampt of summer love  
And moving high up north  
But no one would go  
So I walked up the hill and lay there  
Imagining the day was near  
I know I want to stay there  
And be a great pioneer  
  
I made a promise then  
That I'd find a place  
Where my world won't end  
Give me a piece of land  
That will be my life  
That I will defend  
If I work really hard  
I will surely survive  
I know my virtue is strong  
No one could oppose a spirit so raw  
To be a part of the state  
To be known as a great pioneer  
I keep the fires burning  
To let you know I'm free  
My heart will always be yearning  
  
To be, a part of the state  
To be, a part of the state  
To be, known as a great pioneer  
  
And if it all should end  
And I hear the call  
From the great unknown  
I'll need to go my way  
Let me have my day  
Let me be alone  
  
I was dreaming here and lay there  
Knowing that my time is here  
I know I wanna stay there

To lend a helping hand  
A phone call from a friend  
Just to say I understand  
Now ain't it kind of funny  
At the dark end of the road  
Someone light the way with just a single ray of hope.

""For my own part, I have never had a thought which I could not set down  
In words with even more distinctness than that with which I conceived it.  
There is, however, a class of fancies of exquisite delicacy which are not  
Thoughts, and to which as yet I have found it absolutely impossible to  
Adapt to language. These fancies arise in the soul, alas how rarely.  
Only at epochs of most intense tranquillity, when the bodily and mental  
Health are in perfection. And at those weird points of time, where the  
Confines of the waking world blend with the world of dreams. And so I  
Captured this fancy, where all that we see, or seem, is but a dream within  
A dream. ""

And then in came a cake all decorated in my name  
With four paper brown candles are all spelling out this name  
The clock was passing out from time to time  
I saw it all at the beginning of the ending of my first levity ball

Build ups and barriers hiding behind everything

We lost it all only love was left, and that was the one thing money can't buy.  
  
We're all dust bowl children

And the dust just blows  
When the green fields are gone.  
When the green grass growing fields are gone.  
When the green fields are gone.  
When the green grass growing fields are gone.  
  
Well, they said in California, there was work of every kind.  
The only work that I got out there was waiting on a welfare line.  
Once I had a dollar, once I had a dream.  
But now all the work is being done by a big ol' machine.

Singin' the dust bowl song

As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Sent his son  
  
If I could have a special dream  
Coming true on Christmas morn'  
I would want the world to see  
How his father smiled when Christ was born  
The greatest gift the world has known!  
So come on kids, look high and low  
For all the toys you've dreamed to find  
But I believe you'll never know  
A greater joy than Jesus' love inside  
  
(You gotta know!)  
(Know!)  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Yes, the god of glory  
Sent his son  
  
(Don't you know that)  
Love has come  
For the world to know (know)  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun

Who is full of mercy

Sent his son  
  
Love has come

Andy Williams,I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face,/a/andy+williams/ive+grown+accustomed+to+her+face_20520081.html,"I've grown accustomed to her face  
She almost makes the day begin  
I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon  
Her smiles, her frowns, her ups, her downs  
Are second nature to me now  
Like breathing out and breathing in  
I was serenely independent and content before we met  
Surely I could always be that way again and yet  
I've grown accustomed to her looks, accustomed to her voice  
Accustomed to her face  
I'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget  
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet  
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air  
Accustomed to her face

Any place on earth will do

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday  
I called on dear old Santa Claus  
To see what I could see  
He took me to his workshop  
And told his plans to me, so  
  
[Chorus]  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's making a list and checking it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play  
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day  
You'd better write your letter now  
And mail it right away  
Because he's getting ready  
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

He'd forget to duck at doorways and often he'd get hurt  
I took good care of him for he had no family  
Actually he did, but he forgot who they be  
Johnny often liked to go out on the town  
He'd forget where he'd be going so he'd just wander around  
I knew when he was back for I would hear the smack  
Of his head hitting the doorway but tonight it was alack  
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace  
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face  
I should have seen it coming, he finally lost his mind  
But if his head don't turn up soon then all his hats are mine  
Johnny came towards me but suddenly he stopped  
As if trying to think of something but having no luck  
Still he didn't notice that his head weren't there  
'Til he took out a brush and tried to comb his hair  
I said, ""Johnny where's your cranium?"" but he didn't seem to know  
He just shrugged his shoulders and tried to find his nose  
And the sight of him there topless made me start to cry  
For I feared we'd ne'er again see eye to eye  
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace  
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face  
I should have seen it coming, he should have stayed in bed  
For now I fear he'll spend his life just trying to get ahead  
Refusing to believe that he had split for good  
His lower half and me searched the neighbourhood  
It soon became apparent that his head we wouldn't find it  
He could not retrace his steps, he was absent minded  
Well years went by til late one night I heard a voice I swore  
Was Johnny calling out to me, I flung open the door  
Johnny's head was home, it took a taxi cab  
Alas, it was too late, his body had gone bad  
Johnny's head was homeless, his body was cremated  
And the funeral was harder than he had anticipated  
I should of seen it coming he said in his eulogy  
But never thought I'd have to say I ain't got no-body

I've lost a stranger yet I somehow lost a friend

From the moment I heard I knew  
So short was the passage between life and death  
That I needed some time to take a breath  
So young girl this song's for you

That so many would lose their sleep tonight

The pain that you've put me through  
The pain that I've gained  
But if you die, it will all go away  
All go away  
All go away  
But actually don't die pleash, because I kinda like you a little still  
But not a lot, just a speck  
Like the cheese that's left after I've raided through the fridge  
Why must you remind me of cheese?  
I love cheese but not you  
I only love you a little  
Only a speck

Heart of a woman and just a little bit of pulling power  
The feeling's got me  
I don't know what it means  
I know it must be wrong  
But when you love somebody you dream, and I dream  
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come  
And you're there, and you're gone  
And I'm alive for you  
And my love keeps hanging on  
  
There is no life  
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love  
There is no unifying, if I don't hear you crying  
I'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world  
Together we are strong in love  
And when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can be  
And me, I'm a man on fire  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ready when the lightning strikes and he deed is done  
I'm not a beginner  
But I'm a sinner when the heat is on  
Nothing gonna stop me, got me all that you need  
Woman, when you need somebody  
A woman with a face and a body, you dream, and I dream  
  
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come  
And you're there and you're gone  
And I'm alive for you  
And my love keeps hanging on  
  
There is no life  
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love  
There is no unifying, if I don't hear you crying  
I'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world  
Together we are strong enough  
And when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can me  
And me, I'm a man on fire

Tried to work out where I am

There isn't time to count the shoulders I have cried on  
That's just circumstances , I must take my chances  
But, baby you don't know what I'm saying

Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
If we just try  
We can put it back together, you and I.  
And all the bad is blown away.  
I never said goodbye.  
  
Is the writing on the wall  
That makes you see.  
And it's the saviour of my soul.  
And what I say that must be heard

Close your eyes, don't let go,

Broken wings don't arrive.  
It's a storm but you still survive.  
  
It's gonna take a miracle.  
  
So I go around believing you.  
I say good night, stay forever and  
Nobody knows how much  
I pray for you at night.  
And miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
And yesterday  
There was nothing in my life worth living for.  
You were there and I was born,  
The very strength to carry on  
A miracle has come.  
  
Hold on tight, call my name,  
Don't get caught in the midnight rain.  
Part of me believes in you,  
You're someone I'm not sure of.  
  
Don't look down, I'll be there,  
Like the wind in the cold night air.  
I can see a miracle.  
  
And through it all we rise and fall,  
Tear it apart and stay forever.  
And I know where heaven is  
And somewhere in between  
Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
Red, blue, black and white.  
True light shine on anyone.  
Two hearts make it right.  
And all that love can change.  
  
Close my eyes, don't let go.  
I'll be lost in the falling snow.  
Always out of place alone,

'cause I keep hoping, hoping, hoping you'll appear.  
  
Sure I can borrow a smoke.  
I can sit here all night and tell these jokers some jokes,  
But who wants to laugh, who's gonna laugh  
At a broken heart?  
Oh, my heart is aching, I swear it's breaking.

There is so much I would say to you.  
There are others, I'm not alone.  
A younger brother you've never known,  
And a baby girl who so reminds me of you.

Take a look at the toys around you  
Right before your eyes  
The toys are real  
  
Midnight confessions  
Never heal the soul  
What you believe is fantasy  
  
Your past is your future  
Left behind  
Lost in time  
Will you surrender?  
  
Waiting for the revolution  
Program the brain  
Not the heartbeat  
  
Deliver us to evil  
Deny us of our faith  
Robotic hearts bleed poison  
On the world we populate  
  
Virtual existence  
With a superhuman mind  
The ultimate creation  
Destroyer of mankind  
  
Termination of our youth  
For we do not compute

Say you don't love me  
Say you don't care  
But don't leave me standing here  
Your heart's like a wheel  
  
Just waiting to roll  
It's longing for freedom  
To get out on the road  
You're hungry for something  
  
That you may never find  
So many reasons  
Your love has made you blind  
You say you don't love me  
  
You say you don't care  
So don't leave me standing here  
Don't leave me standing here  
You say you don't love me

Why I was to blame  
Don't leave me standing

Fortune is ever still,

Something has touched, the spirit inside,  
Once there was love now there's a void.  
Nights of deception, ghosts in my mind,  
Am I bewitched, slave to desire.

The ladies of the manor  
Watched me climb into my car and  
I was going down the track about a hundred and five  
They had the stop-watch rolling  
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive  
And yet my mind was blowing  
I drank a bottle of tequila and I feel real good  
I had the tape deck roaring  
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn  
I went of exploring  
I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it  
I was turning tires burning  
The ground was in my sky  
I was laughing the bitch was trashed  
And death was in my eye  
  
I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way  
I had the wheels in motion  
There was Peter and the Green fly laughing like drains  
Inebriation  
The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch  
In my imagination  
But at the canal turn I hit an only patch  
Inebriation  
  
Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain  
I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again  
Ooh can you hear my lies  
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes  
  
So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again  
But there was no tequila  
Then we started on the whiskey just to steady our brains  
'Cause there was no tequila  
And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill  
We began to roll  
And as we get trashed we were laughing still  
Well bless my soul

It's funny how some things turn out  
We're playing at the backyard wondering  
How our life would be  
The boys were always teasing me  
The time we had together the difference  
You were a friend to me  
I never thought you wanted more than that  
You tore me apart my love  
I never thought that I was good enough  
So now that I know I want to say  
Chorus:  
You will always be on my mind  
You will always be there throughout the rest  
Of my life oh baby x2  
We never knew the reason then no  
I was talking to your boyfriend wondering  
'bout my ache inside  
You're always coming back to me yeah  
When times were getting rough and you needed  
Some love from a friend you trust  
I never thought you wanted more than that  
You tore me apart my love  
I never thought that I was good enough  
So now that I know I want to say

Bosson,Love This Life,/b/bosson/love+this+life_20740938.html,"If you feel the whole world is against you  
And you're irritated about what someone said  
Remember  
You control the thoughts that you are thinking  
It's a choice you make and it's all inside your head  
  
When you're late for work and stuck in traffic  
And you feel like Michael Douglas in ""Falling down""  
And then some stupid driver makes you go ballistic  
Just kick back, relax  
And ignore that screaming down  
  
So, Love this life  
Love this life, fill it up with sunshine  
A happy thought  
Is all you need to keep the clouds away  
  
Love this life  
Love this life, fill it up with sunshine  
A little sunshine  
And everything is gonna go your way  
  
When you check the mirror in the morning  
You look pale and old and your waist's  
Hard to define  
And then your Doctor Slim is giving you a warning  
And you accept you'll never work for Calvin Klein  
  
So, love this life...  
  
Why do we worry about tomorrow today when  
Everyday proves us wrong about the worries we  
Had yesterday [x2]  
  
In 5 billion years or more the sun stops burning  
And this world will be a cold and lonely place  
And although our mother earth will keep on turning  
She will have to cope without the human race  
So it's time to love this life and seize the day  
  
So love this life...  
  
So love this life  
Love the ones that do not even deserve it  
And if you can't  
Just forgive them for the things they've done  
Love this life  
Love this life and let your troubled soul shine  
A little shine  
And everything is gonna go your way

So what if I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming I am your man  
And we wake up in a real life conversation...

Still I can't pretend

Then someone tell me why  
Though I try,  
I can't find the words to say goodbye  
  
I could tell her that I'm sorry  
Hope she'll understand  
She will have to do with someone else  
All that we have planned  
I'd rather her hear the truth  
Than hurt her with a lie  
So I tried,  
But I can't find the words to say goodbye  
  
Now I know  
I have to go  
There's no other way  
But goodbye is not what I can bring myself to say...  
  
If I told her ""see you later""  
Then I might be wrong  
'cause this voice inside is driving me  
To find where I belong  
I know I must leave her now but everytime I try,  
Don't know why,  
Ibut I can't find the words to say goodbye...  
Don't know why,

She would smile as if to say  
That the worst was over  
And there'd soon be brighter days  
But I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin'  
She goes to the door  
And ask just once more  
She gives everything she could beg, steal or borrow  
And each time is her last  
But time moves too fast  
And time has run out for our lady of sorrow  
Lady don't you frown  
This time you won't come down  
Just today I watched them as  
They carried her away  
And I can only hope that she  
Has found a brighter day

Then sometimes they can blind you

Til you get your back burned  
Workin' 'neath the wheel  
Till you get your facts learned

Rich man want to be king

Sun against our skin instead of clothes  
When we felt hungry we would eat, whn we felt glad we would dance  
And whenever we felt drowsy we would doze  
  
It was so easy then never takin' any stands  
It was so easy then, holdin' hands  
  
I remember a time when our fears could be named  
And courage meant not refusing dares  
I remember when we took such cares to step never on the cracks,  
No only on the squares  
Or else we'd be abducted by the bears  
  
It was so easy then never makin' any plans  
It was so easy then, holdin' hands  
It was so easy then never makin' any plans  
It was so easy then, holdin' hands  
  
And now we are grown, with debts and regrets  
And broken hearts and sentimental schemes  
Now every tender failure seems to overthrow old dreams  
Love can lead a normal woman to extremes  
  
It was so easy once, holdin' hands without a plan  
It was so easy once holdin' hands  
Just holdin' hands

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring  
And you appear in all your splendor

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms  
In the hush of night while you're in my arms  
I feel your lips so warm and tender  
My one and only love  
  
The touch of your hand is like heaven  
A heaven that I've never known  
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak  
Tells me that you are my own  
  
You fill my eager heart with such desire  
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire  
I give myself in sweet surrender

On a two way street for love  
And I see no end to this dead end 'til you come back home  
And I've tried everything to keep remembering  
One good woman, one good man  
Two shots of happiness in one life span  
It takes a woman and one good man  
To make a one love stand  
The only thing that hurts is the memory  
Of having once lived by myself  
And I tried every kind of hustlin' man, put my love out on a shelf  
Well, he took everything and left my ears ringing  
One good woman, one good man  
Two shots of happiness in one life span  
It takes a woman and one good man

You know what's next when there's nothing planned  
I'm talking 'bout love, you know it takes two  
Well, he took everything and left my ears ringing

Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth  
  
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees! Oh hear the angel voices  
O night divine, O night, when Christ was born  
O night divine, O night, when Christ was born  
  
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming  
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand  
  
So, led by light of a star sweetly gleaming  
Here came the wise men from the Orient land  
  
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger  
In all our trials born to be our friend  
  
He knows our need, to our weakness no stranger  
Behold your King, before Him lowly bend  
Behold your King, your King, before Him lowly bend  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His Gospel is Peace  
  
Chains shall He break for the slave Is our brother  
And in his name all oppression shall cease

Even though I'm so damaged  
I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd

Wouldn't put this on no one else

I don't have to wait in the line  
It's like the club is mine now  
If it was only that simple  
Then what I'm saying is easy to do  
And we know that's not true  
Whatever money can buy  
I probably got it  
That's real talk, yeah  
I see my name in the sky all over the world  
And I just sit hear saying, lucky me  
  
I gotta pose for the cameras  
Even when my world's falling down  
I still wear a smile

Even though I'm so damaged

Complaining to my loved ones I wanna be a star

I wouldn't put this on no one else  
Yeah, lucky me  
  
My dream and it's my heart  
The life of being a star  
You don't even know how hard it is, do you, yeah  
Now I'm thankfully for everything  
And I'm finally becoming a man  
Now I gotta bigger a show to do  
Lucky me  
  
I gotta pose for the cameras  
Even when my world's falling down

Chris Rea,Curse Of The Traveller,/c/chris+rea/curse+of+the+traveller_20030552.html,"On the restless road to nowhere  
There's no certain peace it seems  
Desire to keep on moving  
Till the river of dreams  
Is it just because someone told you  
Is it just because you found  
Old freedom feels uneasy when duty is around  
  
When allegiance asks the questions  
Old freedom twists and turns  
And chokes on codes of honour  
On the sword of no return  
  
And it's the curse of the traveller  
The curse of the traveller  
Got a hold of me  
And it won't let you be  
  
And in sleepless nights  
You'll call her name  
And feel loneliness cold to the bone  
And when the daylight breaks  
This old tired heart aches  
To be such a long way, such a long way from home  
  
And you long for the harbourlights  
But you'll never be free  
Of the craving for refuge  
And the call of the sea  
Always wanting to sell up  
But always needing to buy  
So till the road leads to somewhere  
And that river runs dry  
  
It's the curse of the traveller  
Ain't gonna let you be  
The curse of the traveller  
And it sure got a hold of me

So I'm going fishing  
And I'm going today  
  
I'm going fishing  
Sounds crasy I know  
I know nothing about fishing  
But just watch me go  
  
And when my time has come  
I will look back and see  
Peace on the shoreline  
That could have been me  
  
You can waste whole lifetime  
Trying to be  
What you think is expected of you  
But you'll never be free

I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside  
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry  
My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry  
Well Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell  
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride  
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
C'mon baby  
  
I simply must go - Baby, it's cold outside  
The answer is no - Ooh baby, it's cold outside  
This welcome has been - I'm lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm -- Look out the window at that storm  
My sister will be suspicious - Man, your lips look so delicious  
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore  
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh your lips look delicious  
Well maybe just a cigarette more - Never such a blizzard before  
  
I've got to get home - Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there  
Say, lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand - Your eyes are like starlight now  
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died  
I really can't stay - Get over that old out  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
Baby it's cold outside  
  
Brr it's cold...  
It's cold out there  
Can't you stay awhile longer baby  
Well... I really shouldn't... Alright  
  
Make it worth your while baby  
Ahh, do that again...

See Mary and Joseph, with love beaming eyes,  
Are gazing upon the rude bed where He lies,

While angels sing loud hallelujahs above.

Lift up little hands now and praise Him as they  
Rejoice that a Saviour from sin you can boast,

Sons of their fathers' dream the same dream  
The sound of forbidden words becomes a scream  
Voices in anger, victims of history  
Plundered and set aside, grow fat on swallowed pride  
  
With promises of paradise and gifts of beads and knives  
Missionaries and pioneers are soldiers in disguise  
Saviours and conquerors, they make us wait  
Like fishers of men they wave their truth like bait  
But with the touch of a stranger's hand innocence turns to shame  
The spirit that dwelt within now sleeps out in the rain  
  
For all of our languages we can't communicate,  
For all of our native tongues, we're all natives here  
The scars of the past are slow to disappear  
The cries of the dead are always in our ears  
And only the very safe can talk about wrong and right  
Of those who are forced to choose, some will choose to fight

She's gone  
Vanished in the night  
Broke off the logic of light  
He woke  
Tore the covers back  
Found he was empty inside  
  
So they were told  
When the moon would rise  
The best time to leave with your soul  
She's gone  
But towards the light  
Watching her whole life unfold  
Bruises come out dark  
  
So strong was his hold on her  
Regarded by some as his slave  
He spoke as in a stranger's tongue  
Despair us and drive you away, hey  
Bruises come out dark

Out of this world to me  
My life  
Parted like the red sea  
We flowed  
Easy between the rocks and stones  
Never seemed to stop us  
The years  
Ended in confusion  
Don't ask me I don't know what happened  
But I am  
A man with a mission  
Must be the devil I don't know  
  
It's hard to let go  
Of all that we know  
As I walk away from you  
Hurled from my home  
Into the unknown  
As I walk away from you  
  
Reveal whatever you desire  
To you it may be death defying  
Black day  
In the coldness of winter  
Black words  
Slipping off my tongue  
I say forget it - it's over  
As a dark cloud covered up the sun  
  
It's hard to let go  
Of all that we know  
As I walk away from you  
The sun always sets  
With room for regrets  
As I walk away from you  
  
Give it to me  
Give it to me  
Your inspiration  
Give to receive  
Find all we need  
As I walk away  
  
Just a slave to ambition  
Tension your permanent condition  
So much you've always wanted  
Too much given' you a sore head

Some truth to tell

Close your eyes and hear the call you know so well

Desolate in anger and safe in isolation  
You're about to be the victim of a holy visitation  
By the rites that I've been given

Light rain and a head full of thunder  
Which way, which way  
Two days till I get to you  
I'll be late if I ever get through  
Where I go there'll be no kind welcome

In the lowlands  
Fear will take the place of desire  
And we will fan the flames from on high  
Try for heavens sake  
The sky fell underneath a blanket  
The sun sank as the miles went by  
Sit back with your head on the pillow  
When you remember it makes you cry  
Ghost cars on the freeway  
Like friends that you thought you had  
One by one they are disappearing

You could tell she was not happy by the way she kept on staring  
Past the other side of nowhere at a man she'd like to try  
And the makeup she had painted could not hide the youthful motions  
Of her body fom the music or the crowd  
I started like all the others with my right hand in the pocket  
While she showed us everything the law allowed  
(Play it Pete Drake)  
[ steel - fiddle ]  
Twenty bucks an hour later my one bedroom apartment  
I was feeling weak from all the seeds I'd sown  
She was sweet she was gentle as she introduced my body  
To some pleasures it had never ever known  
When I woke up in the morning she was a laying there beside me  
Like a kitten with her face turned to the sun  
And a look of satisfaction on her lips that make me wonder  
If she ever felt ashamed of what we'd done  
So I left her in Atlanta...

David Allan Coe,Child Of God,/d/david+allan+coe/child+of+god_20586021.html,"Your life laid down, crucified.  
Your arms stretched out and open wide.  
To rescue me so I can be a child of God.  
  
From nail pierced hands and thorn pierced brow  
Your blood flows down to me somehow.  
It cleanses me so I can be a child of God.  
  
Praise to the lamb that was slain  
Praise to the Father who gave His son away  
  
The proof of love, the price of grace  
You traded all to take my place  
And died for me so I can be a child of God

Praise to the Father who gave His son away

Set him down up there on a picnic bench  
And he used to play checkers with them other old menup there  
They used to tell stories bout when they were kids  
Grandpa says he shot the Chief of Police when he was nine years old  
I believe it  
Cause they tell me Harlan Knetucky was the baddest place in the world  
Why they say they used to sit out there on their front porch  
Shoot them revenuers when they'd come down the hollow  
Said they was so young took two of them boys  
To hold the rifle and one to pull the trigger  
Well grandpa he'd lie a little bit  
But I'll tell you there's a lot of stories in Harlan County  
  
Yeah folks in Harlan County Lord they knew that we were poor  
They always called my daddy Preacher Dan  
But daddy weren't no preacher least ways I don't recallect  
Never hear of papa talk of nothin' but the land  
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer yes he was  
Could not read nor write Lord he could barely sign his name  
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer all his life someday when I'm grown I'll be the
same  
  
Well he always grew tobacco though he did not smoke himself  
He had the best tobacco crop around  
And he never touched a drop of liquor that I can recall  
Papa made his livin' on the ground  
Yes Sunday go to meetin' called for more than he could stand  
I guess he felt at home in his old clothes  
But he never missed a Sunday takin' mama to the church  
Maybe it was habit Lord but heaven only knows  
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer...

Halfway across it

Sometimes it's harder to row with the current  
Most of my life I've just rocked on the waves

Is laying shattered on the ground  
Mona Lisa lost her smile  
And the painter's hands are trembling now

And the eyes that used to burn for me  
Now they no longer look my way  
And the love that used to be  
Why, it just got lost in yesterday

And keeps me yearning yearning it won't cool off  
And when a cloudy day begins to storm up  
We'll pity those who find it hard to warm up  
We've got a lovely furnace going for us glowing for us  
  
Burning burning and it won't cool off  
And when a cloudy day begins to storm up  
We'll pity those who find it hard to warm up  
'Cause we got a knocked out furnace going for us glowing for us

Just when I feel there's no excuse for what happens,  
Things fall into place

to find the other half that is true  
Destiny is what we all seek

I believe behind confusion awaits the truth for us  
Past the obstacles we face  
I value our life and trust  
Years of questioning why things happen the way they do in life  
Wishing that I could turn back time,  
So we could join our souls  
I know there is no way to avoid the pain that we must go through

Abusing a portion of light  
While others are sleeping  
And some are escaping  
A serpent spews out fantasy-  
Unjustified blasphemy  
That cannot be condoned  
  
It must be strange to not have lived  
So far into existence  
  
This is not a test of power  
This is not a game to be lost or won  
Let justice be done

There will be zero tolerance  
For the creator of hallowed intentions  
There will be zero tolerance  
Fate is your deciding God  
  
Karma comes crashing down  
Leaving a very deep scar  
Exposing a door to the  
Source of a verbal whore  
Machines supply the altar  
Where virtuous lives are sacrificed  
  
It must be strange to not have lived  
So far into existence  
  
This is not a test of power  
This is not a game to be lost or won

And angels appeared to descend

With half-closed eyes  
Things looked even better

So he'd try to take over and sass Big Mable  
But her great big fist would black little Melvin's eyes

Early next morning, down by the river

Walked out the door but you couldn't say goodbye  
Hide away and left me lonely  
When I asked you why  
You wouldn't be precise  
Now it's my turn, start taking my advice  
  
It's not the way that you love me  
It's not the way that you care  
  
Running down long back alleys  
Pouting like a spoiled child  
You've been acting so crazy, driving me wild  
Your heart is like an elevator  
You tell me that's just human nature  
I've done all I can, I can't seem to change you  
  
It's not the way that you love me

Oh no, it's not the way  
  
Your love is like a nasty habit  
I finally got control but I just can't take it  
I tried to be cool but I just can't make it

You tell me that it's just human nature  
I've done all I can, but just can't change you

Like a daisy I'm awake.  
With no Bromo Seltzer handy,  
I don't even shake.  
  
Men are not a new sensation,  
I've done pretty well I think,  
But this half pint imitation  
Put me on the blink.  
  
I'm wild again, beguiled again  
A whimpering, simpering child again  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep  
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
I lost my heart, but what of it, he is cold I agree  
He might laugh, but I love it, although the laugh's on me.  
  
I'll sing to him, bring spring to him  
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
He's a fool and don't I know it,  
But a fool can have his charms,  
I'm in love and don't I know it,  
Like a babe in arms.  
  
Love's the same old sad sensation,  
Lately I've not slept a wink,  
Since this half pint imitation,  
Put me on the blink.  
  
I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot,  
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot,  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
I'll sing to him, each spring to him,  
And worship the trousers that cling to him.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
When he talks, he is seeking,  
Words to get,.off his chest.  
Horizontally speaking  
He's at his very best.  
  
Vexed again, perplexed again,  
Thank god I can be oversexed again.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.  
  
Wise at last, my eyes at last,  
Are cutting you down to your size at last,  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more.  
  
Burned a lot but learned a lot,  
And now you are broke so you earned a lot,  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more.  
  
Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic,  
Life was so hard to bear,  
Now my heart's antiseptic,  
Since you moved out of there.  
  
Romance finis.  
Your chance finis.  
Those ants that invaded my pants finis.  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more.

I play with her mind, she masturbate with my Porsche  
It's simple love, simple math  
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle on her ass  
Puffin' purple hash welcome to my power circle  
Sucker free, no snitching, and we know when cowards working  
Rolls Royce rollin', rose gold rollie's  
Mba accountants, amounts they get unholy  
But mama still praying for her rubberband man  
  
When them wheels land, Travis Barker drums playin'  
Tap dance to my drum roll, I love a bitch that know to keep me one rolled

I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for 1 more  
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side effects I'm sure  
Went from driving up on some old shit, to drivers opening doors  
This is my town, if you need something just ask for it's yours  
Yea, ask for it's yours, if you ask for it it's done  
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come  
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot  
But they're all playing their role, Put that on everything that I got  
And all I care about is my city, man I can't say it enough  
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us  
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my sect  
I give everybody a piece of this, and I make due what's left  
Yea I do this shit to the death, yea I do this shit till I'm gone  
Yea, I told you that it's our world, and you're foolish thinking I'm wrong  
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel, tat my fucking name on you, let these

Dusty Springfield,Magic Garden,/d/dusty+springfield/magic+garden_20043992.html,"There is a garden  
Something like the shadow of a butterfly  
And lies beyond the gates of dark and light  
And darling, it belongs to me  
  
And when you go there  
There will be such laughter in the dimpled sky  
The songs you sing  
Will drive away the night  
The magic garden  
Has a way of making you feel free  
  
It's the place I've made for you  
From match-boxes and cards and dominoes  
And it won't fall down  
And when your dreaming vanishes  
Like snowflakes in the summer sky  
Melts away in darkness  
And you don't know why the magic garden  
Waits without the gates wide open  
And darlin', I'll be standin' just inside  
  
And when your dreaming vanishes  
Like snowflakes in the summer sky  
Melts away in darkness  
And you don't know why the magic garden  
Waits without the gates wide open  
And darlin', I'll be standin' just inside  
  
It's so soft and warm  
Behind those hedges  
No hard edges  
No hard edges  
  
There is a garden  
Vanishes like snowflakes in the summer sky  
Melts away in darkness  
And you don't know why the magic garden  
Waits without the gates wide open  
And darlin', I'll be standin' just inside

Ed Sheeran,Don't,/e/ed+sheeran/dont_21081306.html,"Ah lahmlahlah  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 1:]  
I met this girl late last year  
She said don't you worry if I disappear  
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake  
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait  
But then I jump right in  
A week later returned  
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn  
But I gave her my time for two or three nights  
Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right  
I went away for months until our paths crossed again  
She told me I was never looking for a friend  
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10  
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin  
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late am  
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said  
She's singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 2:]  
For a couple weeks I  
Only want to see her  
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza  
Before a text message was the only way to reach her  
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her  
Singing out Aretha  
All over the track like a feature  
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either  
But me and her we make money the same way  
Four cities, two planes the same day  
Those shows have never been what it's about  
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out  
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch  
But we should get on a plane  
Or we'll be missing it now  
Wish I'd have written it down  
The way that things played out  
When she was kissing him  
How? I was confused about  
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 3:]  
[Knock knock] on my hotel door  
I don't even know if she knows what for  
She was crying on my shoulder  
I already told ya  
Trust and respect is what we do this for  
I never intended to be next  
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all  
And I never saw him as a threat  
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course  
It's not like we were both on tour  
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor  
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment  
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different  
This is not the way you realize what you wanted  
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest  
All this time God knows I'm singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus 2x:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah

But grant me  
Just the same  
I'm not entirely to blame  
  
For love  
You'd be so easy to love  
So easy to idolize  
All others above  
  
So worth the yearning for  
So swell to keep every home fire burning for  
We'd be so grand at the game  
So carefree together  
  
That it does seem a shame  
That you can't see  
Your future with me  
'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love

Now that we are one, the beguine has just begun.  
Now that we're side by side, the future looks so gay,  
Now we are alibied when we say...  
  
From this moment on, you for me dear  
Only two for tea dear, from this moment on,  
From this happy day, no more blue songs,  
Only whoop dee doo songs,  
  
From this moment on.  
For you've got the love i need so much,  
Got the skin i love to touch,  
Got the arms to hold me tight,  
  
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight,  
From this moment on, you and i, babe,  
We'll be ridin' high, babe.  
Every care is gone, from this moment on.

Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending.  
It was so heavenly, holding you close to me,  
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream,

Til then, my love, how dreary the new day will seem,  
So for the present dear, we'll have to part,  
Sleep tight my love, goodnight my love,  
Remember that you're my sweetheart.

Along with, a note I wrote  
Said ""I love you but, I don't even know why""

Somewhere on the steepest slope  
There'll be an endless rope  
And nobody's crying

Of me walkin' walkin' around, around this trail of tears  
Where the very loud voices of my own fears  
Is ringin' and ringin' in my ears  
It says that love is long gone  
Every move I make is all wrong  
Says you never gave a damn for me  
  
For anything, for anyone

And may the voices inside you that fill you with dread  
Turn the sound of thousands of angels instead  
Tonight where you might be laying your head

On your way to the wishing well  
Swinging off of those gates of hell

When the Gods expect me  
To beg for help  
But I won't even try  
  
I want nothing in the world  
But myself to protect me  
But I won't lie down  
Roll over and die  
  
All I have to do is  
To forget how much I love him  
All I have to do is  
Put my longing to one side  
  
Tell myself that  
Love's an ever changing situation  
Passion would have cooled  
And all the magic would have died  
  
It's easy, it's easy  
  
Until I think about him  
As he was when I last saw him  
And how he would have been  
Were I to be with him today  
  
Tender in his manner  
And my self-consolation  
All I ever wanted  
And I'm throwing it away  
  
It's easy, easy as life  
  
All I have to do is  
To pretend I never knew him  
On those very rare occasions  
When he steals into my heart  
  
Better to have lost him  
When the ties were barely binding  
Better the contempt  
Of the familiar cannot start  
  
It's easy, it's easy  
  
Until I think about him  
As he was when I last touched him  
And how he would have been  
Were I to be with him today  
  
Those very rare occasions don't let up  
They keep on coming  
All I ever wanted  
And I'm throwing it away  
  
It's easy, it's easy as life  
  
And then I see the faces  
Of a worn defeated people  
A father and a nation  
Who won't let a coward run  
  
Is this how the Gods reward  
The faithful through the ages?  
Forcing us to prove that  
All the hardest things we've done  
  
Are easy, so easy  
  
And though I'll think about him  
Until the earth draws in around me  
And though I choose to leave him  
For another kind of love  
  
This is no denial, no betrayal  
But redemption  
Redeemed in my own eyes  
And in the pantheon above  
  
It's easy, it's easy  
It's easy as life

No freeway traffic in the frozen North  
Just a chain link fence full of birds  
And when the harpoon's loaded in the cannon bay

With a broken sun above the clouds  
Caught like Jonah forty fathoms down  
And a sign on the wall says, ""Hope Allowed""  
  
All the cryptic symbols carved on bone  
A far cry from a tattooed rose  
And when the boys in the rigging catch the wind  
We'll all weigh anchor and it's westward ho

He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife  
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's  
He could be coming at your girlfriend next  
  
Verse 1]  
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward  
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward  
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm  
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm  
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair

Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms  
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors  
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors  
Protectors and be sure that you stand close  
Watch each others backs and guard your command post

To settle the score and beat then him mercifully  
For what he first did to me  
It's sure to be the last  
Following footprints with a magnifying glass  
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell  
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail  
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar  
""Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya""

I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps  
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs  
Inside the depths of his basement  
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place? went!  
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes  
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs  
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed  
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned  
They're only powerful when you got your back turned  
I yearned for the day that we finally met again  
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine  
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean  
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen  
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home  
Beating him over the head with the telephone

This is unexplainable, a fight without a battle  
The alarm resounds and someone called in a speaker:  
""This is not a drill, I repeat: this is not a drill...""  
  
Today we die, today we testify  
All we do must come to an end - this is the end  
  
Reversed evolving, turning people into beasts  
They're feasting on eachother, strong consume the weak  
Flaming ruins, society is lost  
Shattered city streets filled with blind, nameless creatures  
The sky cracks open, dust is descending  
Breath the black air, feel darkness in your lungs  
Silence - nothing makes a sound  
But we can still hear, the sound of the alarm  
  
Today we die, today we testify  
All we do must come to an end - this is the end  
  
A distant early warning  
A sound from far away  
We raised our heads  
Towards the sky  
Towards the alarm...

Emmylou Harris,A River For Him,/e/emmylou+harris/a+river+for+him_20050040.html,"I crossed on the river  
There'll be no returning  
I crossed all the bridges  
I watched them all burning  
And now I'm a stranger  
To a strange land I'm driven  
Where all is forgotten  
And nothing's forgiven  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
I think of him now  
On the road I am taking  
And wonder how long  
His heart will be breaking  
But he'll never hear when  
The teardrops are falling  
Or the sound of my voice  
And the name I'm calling  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
So sweep for the sons  
And the dear darling daughters  
For the passing of time  
And the parting of waters  
For all who have passed through  
This world long before me  
To a far distant shore line  
Where no one waits for me  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him

Teasin' my memory teaching me how to lay low  
When I don't want to  
Well love is elusive this I know now  
It's making me crazy leaving me out  
In the open when I don't want to  
The moments of pleasures Never do last  
Are gone like a suitcase full of your past  
Long gone and in a hurry  
Baby, I can't go through this again  
I don't need to go down more then I've already been  
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town  
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now  
The second street beggars alone in their life  
Drunk on a sidewalk to hide from the night  
Like I am They're just like I am  
Baby, I can't go through this again  
I don't need to go down more then I've already been  
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town  
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now

And maybe if she's passing by the window  
She will hear a love song  
And a melody  
And even if the words are not so tender  
She will always remember

Friends stop by and say hello  
And I laugh and hide the pain

you took your coat off and stood in the rain,  
You were always crazy like that  
I watched from my window,  
always felt I was outside looking in on you  
You were always the mysterious one  
with dark eyes and careless hair,  
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care  
Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say  
besides some comment on the weather  
Well in case you failed to notice,  
In case you failed to see,  
This is my heart bleeding before you,  
This is me down on my knees  
These foolish games are tearing me apart  
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart  
You were always brilliant in the morning  
Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee  
Your philosophies on are, Baroque moved you,  
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of you loved ones  
As I clumsily strummed my guitar  
You'd teach me of honest things  
Things that were daring, things that were clean  
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean.  
So I hid my soiled hands behind my back  
Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you  
Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else  
Somebody who gave a damn,  
Somebody more like myself  
These foolish games are breaking my heart  
your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart

Dust and sunlight  
Ever make the sky so blue  
  
Afternoon is hazy  
River flowing  
All around the sounds  
Moving closer to them  
Telling them the story  
Told by Flora  
Dreams they never knew  
  
Silver willows  
Tears from Persia  
Those who come  
From a far-off island  
Winter Chanterelle lies  
Under cover  
Glory-of-the-sun in blue  
  
Some they know as passion  
Some as freedom  
Some they know as love  
And the way it leaves them  
Summer snowflake  
For a season  
When the sky above is blue  
When the sky above is blue  
  
Lying in the long grass  
Close beside her  
Giving her the name  
Of the one the moon loves  
This will be the day she  
Will remember  
When she knew his heart  
Was  
Loving in the long grass  
Close beside her  
Whispering of love  
And the way it leaves them  
Lying in the long grass  
In the sunlight  
They believe it's true love  
And from all around them  
Flora's secret  
Telling them of love  
And the way it breathes  
And  
Looking up from eyes of  
Amaranthine  
They can see the sky  
Is blue  
Knowing that their love  
Is true  
Dreams they never knew  
And the sky above is blue

Don't you double comb your hair  
Don't powder puff  
Just leave it rough  
I like your fingers bare.  
When the night comes down  
I can turn it round  
I can take you anywhere.  
I don't need love  
Forget that stuff  
You know that I don't care  
  
I need a man

Fifty-faced trouble maker  
Two timing time taker  
Dirty little money maker  
Muscle bound cheap skate  
Low down woman hater  
Triple crossing double dater  
Yella bellied alligator

Talk to me  
You know I'm not that kind of girl.  
And I don't care if you won't  
Walk with me  
It don't give me such a thrill.  
And I don't care about the way you look

It was then that I knew  
The tide was coming in  
Aaahh this pattern on the back of my hand  
It makes a joke of me and the veins are like  
Rivers in sand running out to sea  
Nobody slept on the night of the crash  
We were all covered in devil grey ash

I could have been dead  
I could have been underground

Right between the sound machine  
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night  
Any place it goes is right  
Goes far, flies near, to the stars away from here  
Well, you don't know what we can find  
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?  
You don't know what we can see  
Why don't you tell your dreams to me?, fantasy will set you free.  
Last night I held Aladdin's lamp, and so I wished that I could stay.  
Before the thing could answer me well someone came and took the lamp away  
I looked around, a lousy candle was all I found.

The more knowledge I know.  
What to sing, what to bring. What?  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper, deeper, deeper  
Into the vibe,  
What? ha.  
  
Chilling in the corner,  
At the shelter all by myself,  
Checkin' it out, Im not dancing no more,  
But, why? Why? Why? What?  
  
How on Earth?  
Are you supposed to vibe? around the fake ones, the one that say:  
They know what is what,  
But they don't know what is what,  
They just strut.  
What the fuck? What?  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper,  
Into this thing,  
And I pretend,  
That they're not there.  
I just stare,  
Up in the booth at the dread man spinning the song, Spinning it strong  
Playing things like:  
We care bout house, we care.  
  
That's my shit, what?  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper  
When people start to disappear,  
It is about six o'clock,wooo, I'm feelin hot,  
Take off my sweater and my pants,  
And i start to dance,  
And all the sweat just goes down my bass?.  
  
And I pretend that,  
There's nobody there but me in this place.  
  
I get deep yo, I get deep. What? Woo!  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep when he takes all the bass out the song and all you hear is highs,
and it's like: Oh shit! I get deep...  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep when the rhythm flows through my blood like alcohol and i get
drunk, and I'm over the place.  
But I catch myself right on time, right on line with the beat, and it's so
sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet. I get deep, I get deep, I get deep.  
  
Why, if house music was air, then Dr. Love would be my song, and I would only
take deep breaths.  
And fill my lungs with the rhythm, with the bass. I get deep, I get deep.

She said i wanna go out on a picknick with you baby, Under the big bright
yellow sun

But I don't enjoy it half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
  
(Come on and) dance with me  
I want my arms about you  
That those charms about you  
Will carry me through  
  
(Right up) to heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging)  
  
Out together dancing cheek to cheek

But it doesn't matter no more...

She could go on the freeway and grow up to be 15 feet tall  
And very very scary-lookin'  
And then...  
Cars could crash all over the place  
As a result of people with hawaiian shirts on...  
Lookin' up to hear her go ""ha ha ha...""  
Sardines in her eyebrows...  
Lobsters up 'n down her pudenda  
All of them horribly large from graduation...  
And smelling very bad  
And dangerous!  
Maybe a submarine could save her,  
That's right! yes, that's true!  
And bring her back just like a mud-shark...  
Tell 'em what they win, bob!  
Well, therefore ladies:

Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart  
But our friends are back  
So let's raise a tab  
'Cause I found someone to carry me home  
  
Tonight, we are young  
So let's set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
Tonight, we are young  
So let's set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)  
Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)  
Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)  
Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)  
  
The world is on my side  
I have no reason to run  
So will someone come and carry me home tonight  
The angels never arrived  
But I can hear the choir  
So will someone come and carry me home  
  
Tonight, we are young  
So let's set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
Tonight, we are young  
So let's set the world on fire

So if by the time the bar closes  
And you feel like falling down

Though you know me only as anonymous  
  
In dreams at night I carry your books for you  
And when I rise a flame for you  
Always too shy to carry the whole thing through  
  
Like the light from that eternal flame  
Burns for one without a name  
My love forever will remain anonymous

For oiling that front door  
This morning when she wakes  
She won't be thankful anymore  
  
She'll never know how much I cared  
Just that I couldn't stay  
Shell never know the reason why  
I always run away

Burning bridges  
One by one  
What I'm doing  
Can't be undone  
  
And I'm always hoping someday  
I'm gonna stop this running round  
But every time the chance comes up  
Another bridge goes down  
  
Last night we talked of old times  
Families and home towns  
She wondered if we both agree on  
Where we'd settle down  
  
And I told her that we'd cross that bridge  
Whenever it'd arrive  
Now through the flames I see her standing  
On the other side  
  
Burning bridges  
One by one  
What I'm doing  
Can't be undone  
  
And I'm always hoping someday  
I'm gonna stop this running round  
But every time the chance comes up  
Another bridge goes down  
  
Like ashes on the water  
I drift away in sorrow  
Knowing that the day my lessons finally learned  
I'll be standing at a river  
Staring out across tomorrow  
And the bridge I need to get there  
Will be a bridge that I have burned  
  
Burning bridges  
One by one  
What I'm doing  
Can't be undone  
  
And I'm always hoping someday  
I'm gonna stop this running round  
But every time the chance comes up  
Another bridge goes down

She's a stroll through Christmas lights

Though many there were believed in him, still more were sure he lied,

From the path prepared for him.  
Off of the mountain,  
On to a wilderness of ice.

Terror filled their minds with awe.  
  
Simple were the folk who lived  
Upon this frozen wave.

This is he, God's chosen one,  
Who's come to save us from  
All our oppressors.

Flee back up the mountainside.

George Harrison,That Which I Have Lost,/g/george+harrison/that+which+i+have+lost_20059156.html,"He's fighting the forces of darkness limitation  
Falsehood and mortality which bar him  
The way back into the higher world  
While his whole being is bewildered  
He does not know no law of action  
Taking refuge inside himself and he's saying  
  
I need someone to show me  
Illumine my consciousness  
Remove the dark from in me  
And give me that which I have lost  
  
As all had seemed lost a light from Heaven  
Breaking  
A flash inward illumination  
Enriched his life more than any words can tell  
He stood there, life renewed fresh as rain  
Scales were falling from his eyes again  
The bolts of his prison opening he's saying  
  
I found someone who showed me  
Illumined my consciousness  
Removed the dark from in me  
And given me that which I have lost  
  
You people don't have time to listen to him  
You're too busy fighting revolutions  
That keep you back down in the lower world  
Your mirrors of understanding they need  
Cleansing  
Polish away the dust of desire  
Before pure light will reflect in them  
  
You need someone to show you  
Illumine your consciousness  
Remove the dark from in you  
And give you that which you have lost.

George Jones,A Man I Always Wanted To Meet,/g/george+jones/a+man+i+always+wanted+to+meet_20574508.html,"I was thrilled to death, the day that Babe Ruth signed my baseball bat  
I always remember that, the greatest one of all  
When I was out in Hollywood, John Wayne tipped his cowboy hat  
And when I got his autograph, I felt ten feet tall  
I met the great Hank Williams one night, backstage at the Opy House  
He look down and grinned when I said, ""I'm your biggest fan""  
And I was there the day when J.F.K. rode into Dallas  
I walked up to the limousine and shook his mighty hand  
I've met the famous and I've met the best  
But there one man I've never met that outshines all the rest  
And He's one man I always wanted to meet  
He is the King of Kings and He's the Prince of peace  
If I ever get the chance I'll fall down at His feet  
He's one man I always wanted to meet  
Jesus is the man I always wanted to meet

In the world's mighty gall'ry of pictures  
Hang the scenes that are painted from life  
There's pictures of love and of passion  
And there hangs a pictures of peace and of strife.  
  
There hangs pictures of youth and of beauty'  
Of old age and the blushing young bride  
They all hang on the wall, aw, but the saddest of all  
Are the picture from life's other side.  
  
Chorus: (Sang)  
Yes, te picture from life's other side  
Someone has fell by the way  
A life has gone out with the tide  
Aw, That may have been happy some day.  
  
There a poor old mother at home  
She's watching and waiting alone  
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear  
It's just a picture from life's other side.  
  
(Spoken)  
Now the first scene is that of a gambler  
Who'd lost all of his money playin'  
And then his draws his dead mother's ring from his finger  
That she wore long ago on her wedding day.  
  
Aw, it was his last earthly treasure, but he staked it  
And then he bows his head that his shame he might hide  
Aw, but when they lifted his head, they found he was dead  
That's just a picture from life's other side.  
  
Now the last scene is set down by the river  
Of a heart-broken mother and babe  
And as the harbor lights shine and they shiver  
On an outcast that no one will save.  
  
And yet she was once a true woman  
She was somebody's darlin' and pride  
(Sang)  
God help her, she leaps, for there's no one to weep  
It's just a picture from life's other side...

You smiled like the Sun, kisses for everyone  
And tales, it never fails!  
  
You lying so low in the weeds  
Bet you gonna ambush me  
You'd have me down, down, down to my knees  
Wouldn't you, Barracuda?  
  
Back over time when we were all trying for free  
Met up with porpoise and me  
No right no wrong you're selling a song, a name  
Whisper game  
  
If the real thing don't do the trick  
You better make up something quick  
You gonna burn it out to the wick  
Aren't you, Barracuda?  
  
""Sell me sell you"" the porpoise said  
Dive down deep to save my head  
You, I think you got the blues too.  
  
All that night and all the next  
Swam without looking back  
Made for the western pools, silly fools!

As something comes into her mind  
Slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood  
And all of the boys she had waiting in line  
  
Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife  
You see everywhere any time of the day  
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me  
  
The photograph album she takes from the closet  
And slowly turns the page  
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower  
The first one he gave her now withered today  
  
She closes her eyes and  
Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears  
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown  
That broke all their minds back so many years

You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no  
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home  
Wonderin' where the nut-thatch winters  
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away  
  
[Chorus]  
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world  
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own  
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings  
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings, and songs of its own  
  
There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away  
There follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay  
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom and decay  
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own  
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home  
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone  
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

You look above and then you shout  
No other way to say your head is alright  
  
Feeling psyched to be walking  
I wonder why  
All my joys could be open  
No more cries

Still servin niggas through my burglar bar door  
Jordans jeans and a little afro  
8 ball jacket and a pair of stash slips  
I don't give credit that's how a nigga get killed  
And if you got a tilt ya car get peelt  
17 going to da 559  
Like a blind man I don't see know lines  
Thirteen when a nigga did his first crime  
Eighteen when a nigga bought his first nine  
Lyin' I'm frying and I sure aint flying

The speaker read from the manuscript  
""Only forty-percent of all participants have remained alcoholic.""  
And we began to discuss amongst ourselves  
The possibility for a dream-filled holiday  
Order for the new slave trade  
New flag blowing  
We've used up our minds  
We had no way of knowing  
Old flag burning  
We've lost our souls  
There'll be no returning  
We've diverted back  
To the stretch rack  
Only this time  
We won't snap back  
While crossing the parking lot  
A stranger approached me  
Handed me a gun  
He said meet me in the ashes  
Of the old city  
And we're bound.....  
To have.....  
Some fun.

And they will finally realize  
And what's worse - it hurts  
But still they love the bite

I'd like to try but I'm not suicide  
And I would like to kill you  
But that would suit you fine, I realize  
And I will not disgrace myself  
By chasing you around to pull you back  
And I will not give in an inch  
You win before the fight begins

To dine alone  
To build a private zone  
Or trigger a synapse  
And free us from our traps

With my head against my stack  
Spitting teeth and breaking open skin

Champions officially

To build a private zone

And free us from our traps  
  
Save your knock-out punches for the freaks  
Happy little babies with red cheeks  
You will rock them gently out of sync  
  
Confirmations through the wire  
Spitting gas into the fire  
Am I also worthy of a drink?

'Cause no one's ever gonna  
Oh make me come back to this  
World again

I can't feel the pressure  
And I like it this way  
But my body's calling, my body's calling  
Want me to come back to this  
World again  
  
Suspended deep in a sea of black  
I got the light at the end  
I got the bones on the mast  
Well, I've gone sailing, I've gone sailing  
I could leave so easily  
My friends are calling back to me  
I said yeah,  
They're leaving it all up to me when  
All I needed was clarity  
And someone to tell me what the fuck is going on  
Goddammit  
  
Slippin' farther and farther away  
It's a miracle how long we can stay  
In a world our minds created  
In a world that's full of shit  
  
Please understand me  
I'm climbin' through the wreckage  
Of all my twisted dreams  
And this cheap investigation  
Just can't stifle all my screams  
And I'm waiting  
At the crossroads  
Waiting for you  
Waiting for you  
Where are you  
  
No one's gonna bother me anymore  
No one's gonna mess with my head no more  
I can't understand what all the fightin's for  
But it's so nice here down off the shore  
I wish you could see this  
Cause there's nothing to see  
It's peaceful here and its fine with me  
Not like the world where I used to live  
I never really wanted to live...  
  
Zap him again...  
Zap the son of a bitch again  
  
Live your life like it's a coma  
Won't you tell me why we'd want to  
With all the reasons you give  
It's kinda hard to believe  
  
But who am I to tell you that I've seen any reason  
Why you should stay  
Maybe we'd be better off without you anyway  
I got a one way ticket on your last chance ride  
Got a one way ticket to your suicide  
Got a one way ticket and there's no way out alive  
  
And all this crass communication that has left you in the cold  
Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old  
But if home is where the heart is  
Then there's stories to be told  
No, you don't need a doctor  
No one else can heal your soul  
  
Got your mind in submission  
Got your life on the line  
But nobody pulled the trigger  
They just stepped aside  
They'll be down by the water  
While you watch 'em wavin' goodbye  
  
They'll be callin' in the morning  
They'll be hanging on the phone  
They'll be waitin' for an answer  
But you know nobody's home  
And when the bells stop ringing  
It was nobody's fault but your own  
  
There were always ample warning  
There were always subtle signs  
And you would have seen them coming  
But we gave you too much time  
And when you said that no one's listening  
Why'd your best friend drop a dime  
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting for a  
Way to spend our time  
  
And it's so easy to be social  
It's so easy to be cool  
Yeah, its easy to get hungry  
When you ain't got shit to lose  
And I wish that I could help you  
With what you hope to find  
But I'm still out here waiting  
Watching reruns of my life  
When you reach the point of breaking  
Know it's gonna take some time  
To heal those broken memories  
That another man would need  
Just to survive

T'was a night in June by the western moon  
That I met my charming Mary  
Her eyes were as bright as the stars that night  
When she smiled my heart did bubble  
She couldn't make love or turtle dove  
But, oh boy, She could yodel  
  
She yodeled a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
But love meant nothin', she was too cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she could yodel  
  
Well, I said to myself, you silly little elf  
I'll win her heart, that's settled  
I tried to hiss that pretty little miss  
But, oh my, how she battled  
She called me names made me feel so ashamed  
Then she said my fire is nobel  
Then she turned me down, didn't want me around  
But, oh boy, how she yodeled  
  
She yodeled a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
But love meant nothin', she was too cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she could yodel  
  
Next night on thr trail I heard a big wail  
She changed her mind, felt sorry  
Her yodel, you see, was meant for me  
And she said, you had me worried  
I've rode out tonight to make things right  
And I hope you will forgive me  
When I said, why yes, she took a deep breath  
And, oh boy, how she yodeled  
  
She yodeled a yodel as sweet as it could be  
Her heart was as pure as pretty yellow gold  
And it turned to warm from icy cold  
But boy, oh boy, oh boy how she did yodel  
  
Well, then we got married and what do you think  
We're as happy as the birds in the treeses  
Her love is so true and I'm tellin' you  
Her heart no more it freezes  
In a cradle of pine there's a baby devine  
And he never, never grumbles  
He's our own little pet and we can't talk yet  
But I wish you could hear him yodel  
  
He yodels a yodel as sweet as it could be  
He's our own little pet and we love him, you bet

Hank Williams,WHEN GOD COMES AND GATHERS HIS JEWELS,/h/hank+williams/when+god+comes+gathers+his+jewels_20064080.html,"The ceremony was over  
A lad stood alone in tears  
For he had just said goodbye  
To the one he had loved through the years.  
  
He stood all alone with his head bowed down  
As though his heart would break  
Then the Parson came over and took his hand  
And to him these words he did say.  
  
[Chorus]  
When God comes and gathers his jewels  
All his treasures of diamonds and gold  
You'll meet her up there in heaven so fair  
When God comes and gathers his jewels.  
(Substitute I'll meet her, on last chorus)  
  
Each night when the pale moon is shining  
You can see this lad all alone  
With his eyes lifted toward heaven  
He's repeating these words he was told.  
  
[Chorus]

Make some noise and wear your hat in the pool  
Make some love in the day time

Where the passion's burning high,  
By the chair with the leopard skin under the light,  
It's always Penny and me tonight (Sayin' Ohoh, Mmmmm),  
On the plane step up with both my feet,  
Riding in seat number 3 on a flight to nyc,  
Got my bean in a coffee cup next to my seat,  
Catch the view and another good book to read,  
Sitting at home on the friendly skies,  
Missin' her eyes,  
It's always Penny and me tonight,  
Cause Penny and me like to roll the windows down,  
Turn the radio up, and push the pedal to the ground,  
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies,  
Close our eyes, pretend to fly,  
It's always Penny and me tonight, (Singing Ohoh Nonono)  
Staring at a million city lights,  
But it's still Penny and I all alone beneath the sky,  
Feel the wind brushing slowly by,  
If I could soar I would try, to test these wings and fly,  
Away to where the leaves turn red,  
But no matter where I am instead,  
Singin' along to feelin' alright, (Mmmm)

Takin' away all your gold and your money  
Cause dead men won't need it anymore  
Much too long we felt the slash of your whips  
So now you will feel our swords  
  
Freedom the eternal cry will echo high in the sky  
The day will come when all power has been broken  
  
Your blood will flow down to the gates of hell  
Satan will wait for your souls  
Pray to your god he won't help you he's dead  
He won't fool our minds and our souls...anymore!

The tyrants will now feel the steel of the sword  
The chains will be broken by all slaves on earth

Helloween,Deliver Us From Temptation,/h/helloween/deliver+us+from+temptation_20182721.html,"[Bonus track]  
  
A priest caught in lust  
Is roaming the red light  
Pays to indulge his sins  
Body cry  
Each day he awakes  
And prays for forgiveness  
""Our Father"", he cries to his God  
""Set me free""  
Once we may ask for forgiveness  
Someday we could see paradise  
His words echo to his disciples  
Yet again he'll give in to his vice  
Caught and bound by temptation  
So ashamed of running free  
Sweet embrace, captivation  
Carnal truth against out beliefs  
Deliver us  
Deliver us  
His suit hides the truth  
His business is pushing  
Supplying the kings of the street  
Rich man's pride  
Higher than high, a kid passing by  
Blows off his head and escapes  
Outta sight - outta sight  
Who finds the road to redemption  
The preacher, the kid, or the man  
Who will decide it, I wonder  
Vicious circle entangled and trapped  
Caught and bound by temptation  
So ashamed of running free  
Sweet embrace, captivation  
Carnal truth against our beliefs  
Deliver us  
Deliver us  
Once we may ask for forgiveness  
Someday we could see paradise  
His words echo to his disciples  
Yet again he'll give in to his vice  
Caught and bound by temptation  
So ashamed of running free  
Sweet embrace, captivation  
Carnal truth against our beliefs

Hollies,I Am A Rock,/h/hollies/i+am+a+rock_20065772.html,"A winter's day in a deep and dark december  
I am alone  
Gazing from my window to the street below  
On a freshly fallen , silent shroud of snow  
  
I am a rock I am an island  
  
Don't talk of love  
Well, I've heard the word before  
It's sleeping in my memory  
Don't disturb the slumber  
Of feelings that have died  
If I never loved, I never would have cried  
  
Chorus  
  
I build walls  
A fortress deep and might  
That none may penetrate  
I have no need of friendship  
Friendship causes pain  
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain  
  
Chorus  
  
I have my books  
And my poetry to protect me  
I am shielded in my armor  
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb  
I touch no one and no one touches me  
  
Chorus  
  
And a rock feels no pain  
And an island never cries

Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain.  
We gotta leave this town.  
  
And glover was a dancer,  
Imitating eddie cochran by the jukebox.  
In the corner of the room  
'till he was lost.  
Barry 'n me, we used to escape, playing i go ape  
Wearing italian clothes drinking cider talking in the rain  
Hey babe, come over here, let me buy you a beer, what's your name,  
She said ""boy, it doesn't really matter, don't you see?  
You ain't what i want, you ain't what i need,  
You ain't what i fancy, you ain't what i dream of 'n i'd silently leave  
?? you're ugly.  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain.  
I gotta leave this place.  
  
My history is a cop-out  
Somewhere in the dark i got scared 'cause i knew i was gonna loose.  
You know that feeling you get in your guts, all that frustration when you know  
You're going nuts.  
You gotta make a move.  
There was billy and glover and pacer and taylor and valerie and barry  
I remember what he said about that town.  
He said ""i went to london once, came back,  
Wiped the tears from my eyes, looked out the window,  
And it was still pouring down,  
More of that rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain.""  
I'm gonna get a train,  
Never coming back again.  
'cause if i did it would be the same.  
Boy, you really messed up my brain.  
  
All of that rain rain rain,  
Rain rain rain  
Rain rain rain  
Rain rain rain  
  
Take your washing off the line.  
Take your washing off the line.  
Take your washing off the line.

It's gonna rain.

Your homeboys and you ain't shit  
Yeah, you about to get your motherfuckin'  
Ghetto pass revoked motherfucker  
Punk-ass Mark, bitch-made, punk-ass trick in a basket  
You got caught up in the mix  
It's the nigga ya love to hate with a new song  
So what really goes on  
Nothin' but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch  
They hate to see a young nigga rich  
But I refuse to switch even though  
'Cause I can't move to the snow  
'Cause soon as y'all get some dough  
Ya wanna put a white bitch on your elbow  
Movin' out your neighborhood  
But I walk through the ghetto and the flavor's good  
Little kids jumpin' on me  
But you, you wanna be white and corny  
Living way out  
""Nigger go home"" spray-painted on your house  
Tryin' to be white or a Jew  
But ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?  
Get the hell out, stop bein' an uncle Tom  
You little sell-out, house nigga scum  
Give somethin' back to the place  
Where you made it from  
Before you end up broke  
Fuck around and get your ghetto pass revoked  
I ain't sayin' no names, you know who you are  
You little punk, be true to the game  
Yeah, motherfucker  
Yeah, you thought we forgot, huh?  
Yeah, get a little money  
And moves out the neighborhood and shit  
But you still ain't shit  
When you first start rhymin'  
It started off slow and then you start climbin'  
But it wasn't fast enough I guess  
So you gave your other style a test  
You was hardcore hip-hop  
Now look at yourself, boy you done flip-flopped  
Givin' our music away to the mainstream  
Don't you know they ain't down with the team  
They just sent they boss over  
Put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over  
On MTV but they don't care  
They'll have a new nigga next year  
You out in the cold  
No more white fans and no more soul  
And you might have a heart attack  
When you find out the black folks don't want you back  
And you know what's worse?  
You was just like the nigga in the first verse  
Stop sellin' out your race  
And wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face  
Niggas always gotta show their teeth  
Now I'm a be brief be true to the game  
Yeah motherfucker, I see you got your fancy cars and shit  
But you know what, you still ain't shit  
That's right, I caught you slippin'  
You know I could've gat you  
Yeah, but I didn't even trip  
A message to the Oreo cookie  
Find a mirror and take a look, G  
Do you like what you see?  
But you're quick to point the finger at me  
You wanna be the big fish, you little guppy  
Black man can't be no yuppie  
You put on your suit and tie and your big clothes  
You don't associate with the Negroes  
You wanna be just like Jack  
But Jack is callin' you a nigga behind your back  
So back off genius  
I don't need you to correct my broken English  
You know that's right you ain't white  
So stop holdin' your ass tight  
'Cause you can't pass  
So why you keep tryin' to pass with your black ass?  
Mister big  
But in reality, you're shorter than a midge  
You only got yourself to blame  
Get a grip, Oreo and be true to the game  
And Ice Cube practices what he preaches  
He continues to live in South Central, Los Angeles  
And he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood  
Be true to the game

Gonna write your name on a violet star

We'll have a window and we'll have a door  
And a reason to be living for

The drugs that I took have made me impure

I've learned some nasty lessons so I'm shutting  
My mouth  
A fury in my gut is spinning me round

To be a total phony is the winning design  
When the fabric of life is a horny goldmine  
  
The neon forest is my home  
And like a cartoon cat I roam  
Where only kids are still alive  
And anyway they're gonna fry

You can join the ""in crowd"" for being a whore  
Although you are lonely you wish for a fence  
America takes drugs in psychic defense  
You can say what you want but nobody's there

Indigo Girls,Come A Long Way,/i/indigo+girls/come+a+long+way_21099823.html,"I've come a long way  
I was a show on ice  
Dazzling and brittle  
But subject to the sun  
  
And then one day  
I went little by little  
Back to the water  
The place where I'd come from  
  
And I went under  
Like stones tied in a sack  
And I got emptied  
And started my way back  
  
My name  
It's got your name on it  
My shame  
It's got your name on it  
My home  
It's got your name on it  
Everything I own  
  
And all my schemes drowned at the seams  
Have left me fine in my own skin  
I've come a long way  
Just to begin  
  
I've come a long way  
Under the cover of darkness  
Trusting a stranger  
A boatman at the shore  
  
The scourge of hope  
The ugly face of danger  
The keepers of the keys  
Had me down on my knees  
In front of the gilded doors  
  
And in a world where every ax was poised to grind  
To find my peace I only held up what was already mine  
  
My name  
It's got your name on it  
My shame  
It's got your name on it  
My home  
It's got your name on it  
Everything I own  
  
And all my swords have turned to words that blow like poems in the wind  
I've come a long way  
  
I used to be twisted  
When you called it an opiate  
A simple way to cope  
And yet I think you shouldn't skip if you haven't worn the shoes  
  
They start out tight  
And then they hurt your tired feet at night  
But then they give a little day by day  
And then before you know it  
You look back and you've come a long way  
  
It's got your name on it  
My shame  
It's got your name on it  
My home  
It's got your name on it  
Everything I own  
  
You call my name  
My name  
You call my name  
My shame  
You call my name  
My home  
Everything I own  
You call my name  
  
If it's got my name, it's got your name on it  
Everything I own has got your name on it  
When I was trying to cross the river  
You were at the river getting me across and now  
Everything, everything I own  
Has got your name on it  
Oh everything  
I've got your name on it

Most of us stick with our row to hoe  
But not you, you're the black crow  
With a straight line, and no time  
For the birds of prey who wreck your nest

Find the song in you that no one's heard  
Strenghthen your wings as you sing your solo flight  
Through this short life  
Everyone's got a deep regret  
We try to ground ourselves to forget  
But your race to the end is neck and neck  
You love them, you love them not

Teacher's trying to talk but I could give a fuck less  
I'm staring at the freak that I know I'm in love with  
But she don't even know my name it's always been the same  
I just lay my head down and drown in my spit  
Nobody even notices I'm here 'cause I ain't shit  
I hear voices but I don't know what they saying  
Sweat is on my forehead 'cause my brain's inside decaying  
And this bitch that I love probably don't have no idea  
She's talking to her friends I'm in the corner and I see her  
Something's happening but it isn't very clear  
Sounds like a bell, sounds like an electric chair  
Next thing I know walking in the crowded hall  
So many different faces that I throw up on the wall  
Some are yelling ""sick"" and the others stop and stare  
But I don't care, I'm in a hurry going nowhere  
See, my head is spinning 'cause I'm lonely and I'm twisted  
But I have a secret everybody missed it  
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag  
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag

I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day  
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway  
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag  
I cut the bigots head off and I stuffed it in my bag

I wish somebody knew me 'cause then they could say I'm wrong  
But since nobody knows me I got it going on  
I'm staring at the clock, I listen for the tock  
I gotta couple food stamps folded in my sock  
I guess I'm just a ghost 'cause everybody walks through me  
If I died in class they would probably say they knew me  
Or they wouldn't care, they wouldn't even move  
A dead body rotting in the back of the room  
For weeks and months, stinking up the class  
Until somebody noticed then they throw me in the trash  
I can hear the teacher man talking about Columbus  
He nothing but an old dead fuck with a compass  
Ran up on a beach and threw everybody off  
And then he claimed discovery and now we all applaud  
I don't give a fuck to learn your uncle went to hell  
I'm trapped in mind and my brain is my cell  
But I have a key, it's called insanity  
I stick in my brain to unlock eternity  
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag  
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag  
[Chorus (2x)]  
""Okay, today we're gonna learn about A Great Freedom. If you'll turn  
Your textbooks to Chapter Four we'll get started. America's the  
Land of the free, all racists live together in harmony, and we are all  
Treated equal, we all live togerther in the same wealthy community  
And we are alternate equals. Yes?""  
""Man, Mr. Johnson already taught us this. Ain't he ever coming back?""  
""Uh, uh, he's, uh, very ill right now.""

No, they can sit and front about it all day  
But I left his fucking body in the hallway  
And in the morning they opened up the door  
And seen his motherfucking carcass laying on the floor  
But they would never suspect me I'm just a nerd  
I try to speak my word, it always goes unheard  
I could chop my arms off and run around the class  
I doubt they'd even notice, but I'd be dying fast  
'cause they'd rather learn about redneck chicker  
Who owned a couple slaves but I guess it doesn't matter  
Fuck Washington, Benjamin, fuck em all ah  
They can suck my nuts till they wood teeth fall out  
And the class wanna know who could it be  
But I'm like Dewey Boodie, you ain't never heard of me  
I'm just a nobody and I think it's a drag  
But I got his motherfucking melon chilling in my bookbag

I Promise You, I Promise You I Will.  
I will. I will. I will. I will.

The thief on time, stealing  
The hours that keep you away

Straight to my head  
My mind is a planet  
For you to roam

INXS,Soul Mistake,/i/inxs/soul+mistake_20067848.html,"Promises are carved out of lust  
With a fire in the heart  
That burns with no regret  
I vow to play the part  
  
In this a meeting of the soul  
My feelings are unknown  
I learn with no regret  
I'm getting what I get  
  
Feel some pain though I'm miles away  
And ring to let you know  
Are you seeing someone  
I'd better let you go  
  
She said this was a lesson in love  
She said this was a love to end all loves  
This soul never listens to me  
This soul has a lot to learn  
  
Honesty eludes one and all  
Like some gypsy's search for gold  
He's dreaming all the time  
But the gold is hard to find  
  
Made a mistake with myself  
My lover couldn't lie  
She told me of the things  
That made her cry inside

Where would I be  
I haven't said I have all the answers  
How could anyone  
  
Can't stop looking at the lights  
All around my head  
I'm missing the darker side  
Of the man  
  
He's on his knees  
Looking for the door  
But everybody's  
Giving him applause  
  
Crashed the car  
Into a wall  
But everybody's  
Calling for more  
  
It's called the end of rock and roll  
These days are numbered  
Counted out in loss  
Faith and spirit  
Walking hand in hand  
  
To meet a wall  
Made of sound  
But where does that sound  
Find a place today  
  
Maybe we came to the wrong show  
I've seen this before  
  
It's called the end of rock and roll  
Oh shadow take me  
Leave nothing still  
'cause I've not seen the miracle  
How could anyone  
  
We ask too much of the song  
To come and save our souls  
When all it's trying to do now  
Is save its own  
  
Maybe we came to the wrong show  
I've seen this before  
  
Maybe we came to the wrong show  
I've seen this before

So come over here now  
I got a vision for you  
It's my personal snake oil  
It's just something I do  
  
I'm the jester with no tears  
And I'm playing on your fears  
I'm a trickster smiling underneath this mask of love and death  
The eternal lie I've told  
About the pyramids of gold  
I've got you hooked at every turn your money's left to burn  
  
You'll be wanting a contract  
You'll be waiting a while  
I'd like to give you my contact  
But that isn't my style  
  
Well you only get one chance  
And it's too good to miss  
if i didn't lie to ya  
Then I wouldn't exist

It's the same old, same old ride  
The smoke and mirrors visions that you see are just like me  
I'm a banker's face  
With just a letter out of place  
I know someone just like you knows someone just like me

And gone is the gold  
Well if you knew the story  
How come, it has to be told  
  
Well you can say I'm a devil  
And I wouldn't say no  
But out here on the dark side  
Hey, on with the show  
  
So now my tale is told  
Big and bad and twice as bold  
This ship of fools is sinking as the cracks begin to grow  
There is no easy way  
For an honest man today  
Which is something you should think of as my lifeboat sails away

How I felt, as I fell, I just can't recall

How I ran to the man when his hand swayed  
Clarinets were my pets, and a slide trombone I thought was simply  
Divine  
But today when they play I could hiss them  
Ev'ry bar is a jar to my system  
But there's one musical instrument that I call mine

Upon a piano, a grand piano  
It simply carries me away

I love to run my fingers o'er the keys, the ivories  
  
And with the pedal I love to meddle

I'm so delighted if I'm invited  
To hear that long haired genius play

I'll have lots of open time  
  
Friday night will be the test

Sunday you can come and rest

Tho' my interest you've heightened

To the prisoner inside me  
To the captive of my doubt  
Who among his fantasies harbors the dream of breaking out  
And taking his chances  
Alive in the world  
  
[Bridge]  
To open my eyes and wake up alive in the world  
To open my eyes and fully arrive in the world  
  
With its beauty and its cruelty  
With its heartbreak and its joy  
With it constantly giving birth to life and to forces that destroy  
And the infinite power of change  
Alive in the world  
  
[Bridge x2]  
To open my eyes and wake up alive in the world  
To open my eyes and fully arrive in the world

Jackson Browne,Anything Can Happen,/j/jackson+browne/anything+can+happen_20068692.html,"Time will come when we know what happened here  
Change will come in time and make it clear  
We learn one thing if we learn at all  
In the secret wars we call our lives, anything can happen  
We watch the days, we make our plans  
We change in ways, a life demands  
But whatever pleasure this life may allow  
I'll give you the love I have for you now  
Because anything can happen in a world so full of fear  
Dreams are whispered in the dead of night and people disappear  
But you hear my heart and you know I'm still here  
Although you know and I know you know  
While I swear I'll never let you go, anything can happen  
Yeah, if this love can happen here  
Anything can  
We watch the days, we make our plans  
We change in ways a life demands  
I'll always remember this time, this place  
The hope in your voice, the light on your face  
Because anything can happen in a world so full of pain  
People give their lives to making war and we call those people sane  
But I love you where your dreams remain  
Though you never say it anymore  
One day there'll be an end to this war and who knows  
We may see what we're here for, anything can happen  
Yeah, if this love has found us here  
Anything can, it can happen  
Anything can, anything can happen  
Anything, anything, anything, anything

Jackson Browne,Casino Nation,/j/jackson+browne/casino+nation_20173461.html,"In a weapons producing nation under Jesus  
In the fabled crucible of the free world  
Camera crews search for clues amid the detritus  
And entertainment shapes the land  
The way the hammer shapes the hand  
  
Gleaming faces in the checkout counter at the Church of Fame  
The lucky winners cheer Casino Nation  
All those not on TV only have themselves to blame  
And don't quite seem to understand  
The way the hammer shapes the hand  
  
Out beyond the ethernet the spectrum spreads  
DC to daylight, the cowboy mogul rides  
Never worry where the gold for all this glory's gonna come from  
Get along dogies, it's coming out of your hides  
  
The intentional cultivation of a criminal class  
The future lit by brightly burning bridges  
Justice fully clothed to hide the heart of glass  
That shatters in a thousand Ruby Ridges  
And everywhere the good prepare for perpetual war  
And let their weapons shape the plan  
The way the hammer shapes the hand

Jackson Browne,Looking East,/j/jackson+browne/looking+east_20068583.html,"Standing in the ocean with the sun burning low in the west  
Like a fire in the cavernous darkness at the heart of the beast  
With my beliefs and possessions, stopped at the frontier in my chest  
At the edge of my country, my back to the sea, looking east  
  
Where the search for the truth is conducted with a wink and a nod  
And where power and position are equated with the grace of God  
These times are famine for the soul while for the senses it's a feast  
From the edge of my country, as far as you see, looking east  
  
Hunger in the midnight, hunger at the stroke of noon  
Hunger in the mansion, hunger in the rented room  
Hunger on the TV, hunger on the printed page  
And there's a God-sized hunger underneath the laughing and the rage  
In the absence of light  
And the deepening night  
Where I wait for the sun  
Looking east  
  
How long have I left my mind to the powers that be?  
How long will it take to find the higher power moving in me?  
  
Power in the insect  
Power in the sea  
Power in the snow falling silently  
Power in the blossom  
Power in the stone  
Power in the song being sung alone  
Power in the wheat field  
Power in the rain  
Power in the sunlight and the hurricane  
Power in the silence  
Power in the flame  
Power in the sound of the lover's name  
The power of the sunrise and the power of a prayer released  
On the edge of my country, I pray for the ones with the least  
  
Hunger in the midnight, hunger at the stroke of noon  
Hunger in the banquet, hunger in the bride and groom  
Hunger on the TV, hunger on the printed page  
And there's a God-sized hunger underneath the questions of the age  
And an absence of light  
In the deepening night  
Where I wait for the sun  
Looking east

We only talk about what happened last

From a life in disarray  
And all these recriminations

And you're behaving like an orphan child

What's right in front of you  
Can't be the one for you

There are feelings that you can't hold back  
And you're so caught up

But they fail to understand

I got you  
And nobody can come to change a thing

And if somebody tries to take you from me  
They will see I've got you  
You got me  
  
I got you  
  
Things are often said to  
Doubt what I feel for you  
But words that people say  
Won't take my love away  
Although it hurts sometimes, it's alright  
But why they say some things that ain't right  
I never know but please understand that baby, it ain't nothing  
  
All that talk of us not able to last  
Just because of mistakes we made in the past  
But they fail to understand

You got me (you got me, baby)  
I got you (I got you, baby)  
You got me (you got me, baby)

gotta do is simply love, trust, and just stay focused on us  
Together we'll get through whatever if we  
Don't let speculations make situations up  
We'll be alright  
  
I got you  
And nobody can come to change a thing  
'Cause you gotta know

And nobody can come to change a thing (feels so good inside)  
'Cause you gotta know

And it feels so good to have your back now

I'm real, I thought I told you  
I really been on Oprah  
That's just me  
Nothin phony, don't hatethe red hair  
What you get is what you see  
  
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got  
I'm still, I'm still timmy from the block  
Used to have a little, now I have a lot  
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)  
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got  
I'm still, I'm still timmy from the block  
Used to have a little, now I have a lot  
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)  
  
I'm down to earth like this  
Rockin this business  
I've grown up so much  
I'm in control and loving it  
Rumors got me laughing, kid  
Love my life and my public  
Put God first  
Then can't forget to stay real  
To me it's like breathing  
  
Don't be fooled by the cocks that I get  
I'm still, I'm still timmmyy from the block  
Used to have a little, now I have a lot

I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block  
Used to have a little, now I have a lot  
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)  
  
It take hard work to cash checks  
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, now assets  
You get back what you put out  
Even if you take the good route  
Can't count the hood out  
After a while, you know who to blink with  
Just keep it real with the ones came in with  
Best thing to do is stay low, LOX and J.Lo  
Act like they don't, but they know  
  
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got  
I'm still, I'm still timmy from the block  
Used to have a little, now I get a lot  
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)  
Don't be fooled by the cocks that I got

When you felt like this  
With a unimaginable kiss that's made especially for me  
You can't avoid it  
I'm telling you to look  
If I carressed you  
You would melt away in my hands  
  
Chours:  
Dream with me  
Come and let me feel it  
The pasion that was born in me  
With the fire of your love  
Just one more night  
I wantto be next to you and fly  
Be your vice and a little more  
The wish for your love  
I want to provoke you slowly now that I have you here  
What noboy else is suppose to give  
That's what I'm giving you  
You can't avoid it  
I'm telling you to look  
If I carressed you  
You'd melt away in my hands

Here you have me, I'm all yours  
What you've been looking for in me, I'm giving to you

If words could make wishes come true  
I'd save every day like a treasure and then,  
Again, I would spend them with you

To do the things you want to do  
Once you find them  
I've looked around enough to know  
That you're the one I want to go  
Through time with  
  
If I had a box just for wishes  
And dreams that had never come true  
The box would be empty  
Except for the memory  
Of how they were answered by you

As she slams the door in his drunken face,  
And now he stands outside and all the neighbors start to gossip and drool.  
  
He cries ""Oh girl, you must be mad,  
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?""  
Against the door he leans and starts a scene,  
And his tears fall and burn the garden green.  
  
And so castles made of sand, fall in the sea, eventually.  
  
A little Indian brave who before he was ten, played war games in  
the woods with his Indian friends, and he built a dream that when he  
grew up, he would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief.  
  
Many moons passed and more the dream grew strong, until tomorrow  
He would sing his first war song,  
And fight his first battle, but something went wrong,  
surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night  
  
And so castles made of sand, melts into the sea eventually.  
  
There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown,  
Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a sound  
And she wished and prayed she would stop living, so she decided to die.  
She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and to her legs she smiled  
  
""You won't hurt me no more.""  
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say  
""Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way""  
And it really didn't have to stop...it just kept on going.  
And so castles made of sand slips into the sea,  
Eventually

Then i was king of the highway  
Trying to make it look fast and easy  
And dreamin' of doin' it my way  
Let's put the top down baby  
Feel the wind in our hair  
  
We were too young to know better  
And too cool to care  
  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby you're only along for the ride  
Only along for the ride  
  
Rock and roll on the radio  
Let's turn it up and get down  
  
Convertible dreams running wild in the streets  
In the all time american town  
When you played the thrill queen, baby  
I heard the jazz of joy  
You were every girl in the world  
But i wasn't every boy  
  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby, you're only along for the ride  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby, you're only along for the ride  
Only along for the ride

Are the clours i painted this song  
You were 19 and perfect, baby  
But no one stays perfect too long

As we go marching, marching  
In the beauty of the day  
A million darkened kitchens  
A thousand mill lofts grey  
Are touched with all the radiance  
That a sudden sun discloses  
For the people hear us singing  
Bread and roses, bread and roses  
  
As we go marching, marching  
We battle too for men  
For they are women's children  
And we mother them again  
Our lives shall not be sweetened  
From birth until life closes  
Hearts starve as well as bodies  
Give us bread, but give us roses  
  
As we go marching, marching  
We bring the greater days  
For the rising of the women  
Means the rising of the race  
No more the drudge and idler  
Ten that toil where one reposes  
But the sharing of life's glories  
Bread and roses, bread and roses

The fact I don't believe that I know what it means any more  
  
When the sun is slowly fadin' in the western sky  
Sometimes it takes forever the day to end  
Sometimes it takes a lifetime  
Sometimes I think I'll never see the sun again  
  
The sun again  
Sun again

All the chains holding me

Say 'em loud, say 'em clear  
For the whole round world to hear  
I wish I could share  
All the love that's in my heart  
Remove every doubt  
That keeps us apart

What it means to be me

Every man should be free

Yes sir, and I'm way, way over due  
I wish I could be  
Like a bird up in the sky  
How sweet it would be  
If I found out I could fly  
So long to the sun  
And look down upon the sea  
And I sing because I know  
How it feels to be  
And I sing because I know  
How it feels  
And I sing because I know  
How it feels to be free, yeah

Like the highlands that I always see  
In my dreams of home  
I am never alone when I am there  
  
Islands like so many dreams  
Are like canyons but off the main stream  
And there's no one there  
The dreamer is always alone

And the mighty blue ocean  
Keeps rolling on every shore  
Like the spirit that binds us together  
We are so much more than islands  
  
Islands belong to the sea  
Like the dark sands of my memory  
When the morning comes  
They are stepping stones to the sun

John Denver,It's Up To You,/j/john+denver/its+up+to+you_20073248.html,"This song was first released on the Back Home Again album. It is the only
album it has been released on.  
You can do whatever you want to do  
Wherever you want to go it's up to you  
And wouldn't it be fine  
Following your heart, playing your own part  
You and me out on a farm, let the sun be our alarm  
Kickin' off your shoes, doin' what we choose  
And wouldn't it be fine  
Knowing that your mine anytime you want to be  
But I don't want to own you  
I just want to hold you  
I don't want to need you  
I just like to see you smile and stay for awhile  
And if the times get rough, being free might be enough  
To see us through the storm and keep our feelings warm  
And wouldn't it be fine  
Looking back and knowing that we helped each other find  
You can do whatever you want to do  
Wherever you want to go it's up to you  
And wouldn't it be fine  
Following your heart knowing from the start  
It's up to you  
It's up to you  
It's up to you

John Denver,Love Again,/j/john+denver/love+again_20073311.html,"I didn't think it could happen again  
I'm just too old and set in my ways  
I was convinced I would always be lonely  
All of the rest of my days  
Maybe I give up on romance  
In my longing to give up the pain  
I just didn't believe I would ever love again  
  
I was like one who had shut myself in  
Closed the windows, locked all the doors  
Afraid of the dark and the beat of my heart  
Yet knowing there had to be more  
Though it sounds like a great contradiction  
It's the easiest thing to explain  
You see, I was afraid I might never love again  
  
What does it take for a blind man to see  
That there's more there than just meets the eye  
What are the ways that the magic comes in  
That can turn a song into a sigh  
Sometimes I think that I'm dreaming  
Or maybe I'm going insane  
Or maybe it's just that I'm falling in love again  
  
Here I am standing beside you  
Oh life's such a wonderful game  
Look at me now, I'm falling in love  
Look at me now, I'm falling in love  
Look at me now, I'm falling in love again

He'd hear an old freight train.  
Then he'd have to go.  
Said he'd been blessed with a gipsy bone.  
  
That's the reason they guessed  
He'd been cursed to roam.  
Came into town back before the war.  
  
Didn't even know what it was  
He was looking for.  
He carried a tattered bag for his violin.  
  
It was full of lots of songs  
Of places that he'd been.  
He talked real ea-sy had a smiling way  
  
To pass along to you  
When his fiddle played.  
Making people drop their cares and woes.  
  
To hum out loud those tunes  
That his fiddle howed.  
Till the people there began to join that sound.  
  
And everyone in town was laughing.  
Singing, dancing round.  
Like the fiddler's tune was all they heard that night.  
  
As if some dream said  
""All the world is right""  
His fiddler's eye caught one beauty there.  
  
She had that rollin' flowin'  
golden kind of hair.  
He played for her as if she danced alone.  
  
He played his favorite songs.  
Ones he called his own.  
He played until she was the last to go.  
  
He stopped and packed his case  
And said he'd take her home.  
  
All the nights that passed a child was born.  
All the years that passed.  
That love would keep them warm.  
All their lives they'd share a dream come true.  
  
All because she danced  
while his fiddle tuned.  
My old man had a rounder's soul.  
  
He'd hear an old freight train.  
Then he'd have to go.  
All that I recall said when I was so young.  
  
No one else could really  
Sing those songs he sung.

As a Wal-Mart superstore  
Oh, uh-huh  
  
I'm taking walk (Taking a walk)  
I'm going outside (Going outside)  
I'm taking a walk (Taking a walk)  
I don't need a ride (Just getting by)  
I'm watching the birds (Taking a walk)  
Flying so high (Going outside....)

There is still one smiling face the Gods would see  
But she'll walk along beside me up those golden stairs  
Oh, they'll never, ever take her love from me  
  
What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave  
And watch her love turn into sympathy  
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave  
Oh they'll never, never take her love from me  
  
I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness  
That we shared together in the use to be  
Someone else's arms may hold her now in fond caress  
But they'll never, never take her love from me  
  
Well, I though I'd make her happy if I'd step aside  
But I knew her love would never set me free  
And even on the morning she became another's bride  
I said they'll never, never take her love from me  
  
No, they'll never, never take her love from me

The mother brought a light and held her daughter tight  
She thought it was so strange to hear a little girl of nine  
Cry, ""Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine""  
Her mother wiped the tears and said, ""See honey, you're only dreaming  
Your dad must work today, he has to draw his pay""  
She left her then but still could hear her cry time after time  
""Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine""  
Then the countryside was shaken by a mighty rumble  
And fear for miles around was the trembling of the ground  
The little girl was fast asleep, yet cried out one more time  
""Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine""  
Ten thousand tears and two weeks later deep in the smoking ground  
A dying man was found had survived all those around  
He'd quickly crawled to a fresh air pocket barely just in time  
When he heard his own child whine, ""Call daddy from the mine  
Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine""

Mama called us together and mama tried to smile  
She said you know the cotton crop hasn't been too good this year  
There's just no spending money and well at least we're all here  
I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents  
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat  
That's quite a blessing that'll make things a little more pleasant  
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were  
At least we were all healthy and best of all we had her  
Roy cut down a pigapple tree and we drug it home Jack and me  
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread  
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed  
Mama and daddy sacrificed cause this Christmas was lean  
But after all there was the babies Tom and Joanne babies need a few things  
I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack and though we fought now and then  
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him  
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks  
And when she ironed them down you couldn't tell that they hadn't come from
town  
A sharecropped family across the road didn't have it as good as us  
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk  
And mama said well I bet they don't even have coaloil or beans to boil  
A log apples cranges and such  
Me and Jack took a jar of coaloil nd some hickernuts we'd found  
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set 'em down  
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door  
She picked up the coaloil and hickernuts and said  
I sure do thank ye and quickly closed the door  
We started back home me and Jack and about halfway we stopped looked back  
And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light  
So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night  
Christmas came and Christmas went Christmas that year was heaven sent

In the farmer's almanac, it says  
'If a man could have half his wishes he could double his trouble'  
  
A sweet old lady was eighty-four  
When her kinfolks came for a month or more  
Now from overwork she's on the other shore  
Much too late was y'all come back  
And it says in the farmer's almanac, it says  
'Visitors and fish smell after three days'  
  
Our leader was a silver tongued man  
He deceived the people of the land  
And when he got caught he couldn't stand  
It's a little off-beat and a little off-track  
But it says in the farmer's almanac, it says  
'In rivers and bad government the lightest things flow to the top'  
  
Rod said, ""I don't believe in God""  
Rod died and lies beneath the sod  
For God did not believe in Rod  
Life is a troubled and a weary track  
But it says in the farmer's almanac, it says  
'Feed your faith and your doubts will starve to death'  
  
The little boy followed the honeybee  
And it flew straight to the honey tree  
He got stung but got the honey free  
Consolation for the things you lack

He came home three hours late from work  
Said, ""I had a flat and fell in the dirt""  
She said, ""You gotten lipstick on your shirt""  
Well it turned out like Jill and Jack  
And it says in the farmer's almanac, it says  
'Lies have to be covered up, truth can run around naked'  
  
He said, ""Honey, you know I'm true  
I just look at other women that's all I do""  
Then she caught him with her best friend Peggy Sue  
Sometimes some women will look back  
And it says in the farmer's almanac, it says  
'There's a lot of difference in window shoppin' and shop liftin''  
  
I sat down at a shoeshine stand  
I had a real slow shoeshine man  
I said you don't pop that rag like some of 'em can  
He looked at me and then he sat right back  
It says in the farmer's almanac, it says  
'The trouble with the world today is

I came to believe that I needed help to get by

And wild and sweet the words repeat

I thought how as the day had come  
The belfries of all Christendom  
Had rolled along unbroken song  
Of peace on earth goodwill to men.  
  
And in despair I bowed my head  
There is no peace on earth I said  
For hate is strong that mocks the song  
Of peace on earth goodwill to men.  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep  
God is not dead, nor doubt he sleeps  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail  
With peace on earth goodwill to men.  
  
'Til ringin' singin' on its way  
The world revolve from night to day  
A voice, a chime, a chance so blind,  
On earth goodwill to men.  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep  
God is not dead nor doubt he sleeps  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail

On acid stars you're getting there

Snakebite evangelists and racketeers  
And big wig financiers

Money is the road to justice  
And power walks it on crooked legs

Thieves and sycophants parade  
And where it's made,

In these games of buy and sell  
And some like poor beast  
Are burdened down to breaking

He takes his baggage off the carousel  
He takes a taxi into town  
Yellow schools of taxi fishes  
Jonah in a ticking whale  
Caught up at the light in the fishnet windows  
Of Bloomingdale's  
Watching those high fashion girls  
Skinny black models with Raven curls  
Beauty parlor blonds with credit card eyes  
Looking for the chic and the fancy  
To buy  
  
He opens up his suitcase  
In the continental suite  
And people thirty stories down  
Colored currents in the street  
A helicopter lands on the Pan Am roof  
Like a dragonfly on a tomb  
And business men in button downs  
Press into conference rooms  
Battalions of paper-minded males  
Talking commodities and sales  
While at home their paper wives  
And paper kids  
Paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid  
  
Yellow checkers for the kitchen  
Climbing ivy for the bath  
She is lost in House and Gardens  
He's caught up in Chief of Staff  
He drifts off into the memory  
Of the way she looked in school  
With her body oiled and shining  
At the public swimming pool

The more I feel my love increase  
I'm building all my dreams around you  
Our happiness will never cease  
Cause nothing's any good without you  
Baby you're my centerpiece  
  
We'll find a house and garden somewhere  
Along a country road a piece  
A little cottage on the outskirts  
Where we can really find release  
Cause nothing's any good without you  
Baby you're my centerpiece  
  
Shining hair and shining skin  
Shining as she reeled him in  
To tell him like she did today  
Just what he could do with Harry's House

And if you love the lord, you will love his holy commands.  
Delight yourself in them, and everything you do will surely stand.  
  
We are his workmanship, created for good works in Christ.  
He calls us to offer up ourselves a living sacrifice.  
  
Well if you love the lord, his discipline you wont despise.  
Cause it will prove to you, that you're a child in his eyes.  
And if you love the lord, you'll seek his face with all your heart.  
And even when you're old, from his holy place you wont depart.

But we go the other way.  
  
So he carries the burden alone,  
  
While his children are busy at play,  
  
Feeling so called to stay.  
  
  
Oh, how God grieves and believes that the world can't be saved,  
  
Unless the ones he's appointed obeys,  
  
His command and his stand for the world,  
  
That he loved more than life.  
  
Oh he died, and he cries out tonight.  
  
Jesus commands us to go,  
  
It should be the exception if we stay.  
  
It's no wonder we're moving so slow,  
  
When his church refuses to obey,  
  
Feeling so called to stay.  
  
  
Oh how God comes, as he starts the great judgment of fire,  
  
So he can gain, his greatest desire.  
  
Cause he knows that the souls of the lost,  
  
They can only be reached, through us,  
  
We're his hands and his feet.

Until you soften your heart

You don't learn a thing

You'll never die,  
You'll live forever  
You'll never die,

Take care of forever now  
  
You tell everyone to keep on smiling  
Your outlook on life is so positive  
But deep down inside  
You're searching for a reason to live  
  
Like everyone else you're scared of dying  
But the power of death has been blown apart  
And you'll live forever  
If you soften your heart

I swear I see the stars come out  
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind,  
Just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down  
  
I wanna see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time  
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile  
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi  
And that was the beginning of my heart spinnin' like these wheels in my head
tonight

I swear I see the stars come out  
And when you hold my hand and I look into your eyes  
Oh I swear it looks like you're waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go
down  
  
I swear it's like you're waiting on the sun to go down

And so, if I seem broken and blue  
Walk on by  
Boy, walk on by  
  
Foolish pride, all that I can feel  
So let me hide the tears and the sadness  
You gave me when you said goodbye  
Boy, walk on by  
  
Ooh, ooh, make believe that you don't see the tears, honey  
Let me grieve in private  
Cause each time I see you  
I just break down and cry  
Oh oh, just walk on by  
Walk on, walk on  
Ooh, ooh  
Oh, walk on by

So she belted it  
She hit the high notes fearlessly  
Oh, she melted them  
She brought them to their feet  
  
She was a big star  
At Banana Joe's Bar  
Where she sang karaoke every night  
She said if you work hard to get where you are  
It feels good in the hot spotlight  
She was a big star  
  
She made the local cable shows  
Where the camera fell in love with her face  
After a couple of weekends  
The groupies were crawling all over the place  
And she signed autographs  
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt  
And in the aftermath  
That small time town was hers

At Banana Joe's Bar  
Where she sang karaoke every night  
She said if you work hard to get where you are  
It feels good in the hot spotlight

Hey, she doesn't care anymore  
That her high school girlfriends cut her down  
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't  
And where she is now  
  
A few old neighbors swear they are certain  
She slept her way to the top  
She knows you don't get where you're goin'  
Unless you got something they ain't got  
So she sings tonight  
To twenty thousand plus  
And the young girls scream out loud  
Man that could be us

She eats caviar  
Just before she performs every night  
She says if you work hard to get where you are

Close by you, when you call, I'll take my stand  
One chance to make or lose it a-a-all  
This time my journey to wherever you are-are-are  
I sail on your river, so far my love we'll never be found

And the power of love lives for making you mine  
And in the light of close investigation  
Is it only my imagination, I got you, I got you  
  
Moonlight shining on your face. my bridges burned  
With all my tears that you replaced  
Two hearts together is a beautiful sight  
I'll take you to heaven, so far my love will follow you there-ere  
  
If we believe we got eye-eyes that see in the dark  
And the power of love lives for making you mine  
Am I the light of someone you need more of  
Let me be that love you can be sure of  
Is it only my imagination, I got you  
  
Like the eagle that flies in the sun  
I'll be lost in your fire before we are do-o-one  
And the view from my window is brighter  
Born to be all you need

To be seen with some other man  
You're wanting me to watch him, enjoy the freedom  
You're letting him take with his hands.  
  
Did you tell or must I tell him, Diana  
Does it matter to that kind of man?  
Any place he touches or kisses, Diana  
Is some place I've already been.  
  
You know you're fighting fire with fire  
Over something that broke us apart  
At least I was hiding and trying, Diana  
To keep it from breaking your heart.  
  
You must've been crazy, for taking advantage  
Of the fact that you weren't around  
But she was so soft and pretty  
And she made a promise, never to utter a sound.  
  
Can you tell or must I tell you, Diana  
It's a heart burning hell that I'm in  
And any place he touches or kisses, Diana  
I'd gladly crawl back there again.

Most days he went hungry, then the summer came  
He met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco's Mabel Joy  
Destitutions child born of an L.A. street called shame  
  
Growing up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy  
Laughter found their mornings, brought a meaning to his life  
Yes, the night before she left, sleep came and left that Waycross  
Country boy with dreams of Georgia cotton and a California wife  
  
Sunday morning found him standing 'neath the red light of her door  
When a right cross sent him reeling, put him face down on the floor  
In place of Mabel Joy he found a merchant mad marine  
He growled that Georgia neck is red, but sonny your still green  
  
He turned twenty-one in a gray rock federal prison  
The old judge had no mercy for a Waycross Georgia boy  
Starin' at those four gray, in silence he would listen  
That midnight freight he knew would take him back to Mabel Joy  
  
Sunday morning found him lyin' 'neath the red light of her door  
With a bullet in his side he cried have you seen Mabel Joy  
Stunned and shaken someone said she's not here no more  
She left this house four years today

She was searching for something she'd lost in her teens  
  
Misunderstandings caused by lack of honesty  
They got him worried, got her feeling guilty  
Felt so sincere but she was easily impressed  
And every time she had the chance she got undressed

When we finally kiss goodnight,  
How I'll hate going out in the storm!  
But if you'll really hold me tight,  
All the way home I'll be warm.  
  
The fire is slowly dying,  
And, my dear, we're still good-bying,  
But as long as you love me so,  
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

And you're makin' me run again oh-oh-oh  
When you're calling I'm climbing the wall  
I know that I'm only to blame  
Feels so divine when you're close to the line  
And there's reason to run again oh-oh-oh  
Make me wait it's a beautiful ache  
I know that it's part of the game  
  
I've got mud on my face  
From every thrill of the chase  
But I'm fine  
My heart is heavy with dirt  
And every little bit hurts  
I don't mind  
I give as good as Itake  
And boy you're letting me break my rules  
I love the lows and the highs  
You make me twinkle inside  
And I'm cool  
  
It doesn't matter what the movies say  
(Oh no) I like it better when you walk away  
And you can fool me with those golden eyes  
(Oh yeah) We're on the road to knowing satisfied  
  
Chorus  
'Cos loving you don't mean Ilost my groove  
And baby breakfast in bed don't mean I'll get in the mood  
'Cos loving you don't make me on your side  
You can't take the diamonds that are in my eyes  
'Cos loving you don't mean Ilost my groove  
And baby breakfast in bed don't mean I'll get in the mood  
'Cos loving you don't make me on your side  
You can't take the diamonds that are in my eyes  
  
So when the good times fly and it's cold outside  
I won't be dancing with myself  
And if the world's unfair and it's cold out there  
I won't be dancing with myself  
So when I got no jive and it's cold outside  
I won't be dancing with myself  
I let my heartbeat go 'cos inside I know  
I won't be dancing with myself  
  
It doesn't matter what the movies say  
(Oh no) I like it better when you walk away  
And you can fool me with those golden eyes  
(Oh yeah) We're on the road to knowing satisfied

Savouring the pure desire the passions come undone,  
With every kiss,  
The colors change, bleeding into one.  
In days gone by, I'd be wandering if this feelings gonna last,

Were so gallantly streaming.  
And the rocket's red glare,

For the first time  
Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine  
I want to press your lips on mine  
  
For the first time  
Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine  
Love is something  
You can't get in a five and dime  
  
And love is the question of more time  
And love is something  
That's really hard to find  
Love makes a strong man  
  
Get down on his knees in the crowd  
Just lay your hand  
On mine  
Yeah, for the first time  
  
Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine  
And I wonder If you'll ever really be mine

Leonard Cohen,Take This Longing,/l/leonard+cohen/take+this+longing_20082833.html,"Many men have loved the bells  
You fastened to the rein,  
And everyone who wanted you  
They found what they will always want again.  
Your beauty lost to you yourself  
Just as it was lost to them.  
  
Oh take this longing from my tongue,  
Whatever useless things these hands have done.  
Let me see your beauty broken down  
Like you would do for one you love.  
  
Your body like a searchlight  
My poverty revealed,  
I would like to try your charity  
Until you cry, ""Now you must try my greed.""  
And everything depends upon  
How near you sleep to me  
  
Just take this longing from my tongue  
All the lonely things my hands have done.  
Let me see your beauty broken down  
Like you would do for one your love.  
  
Hungry as an archway  
Through which the troops have passed,  
I stand in ruins behind you,  
With your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps.  
I love to see you naked over there  
Especially from the back.  
  
Oh take this longing from my tongue,  
All the useless things my hands have done,  
Untie for me your hired blue gown,  
Like you would do for one that you love.  
  
You're faithful to the better man,  
I'm afraid that he left.  
So let me judge your love affair  
In this very room where I have sentenced  
Mine to death.  
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves  
That he's shaken from his head.  
  
Just take this longing from my tongue,  
All the useless things my hands have done,  
Let me see your beauty broken down,  
Like you would do for one you love.  
Like you would do for one you love.

How come you called me here tonight?  
How come you bother  
With my heart at all?  
You raise me up in grace,  
Then you put me in a place,  
Where I must fall.  
  
Too late to fix another drink  
The lights are going out  
I'll listen to the darkness sing  
I know what that's about.  
  
I tried to love you my way,  
But I couldn't make it hold.

I got no future,

The present's not that pleasant  
Just a lot of things to do  
I thought the past would last me  
But the darkness got that too  
  
I shoulda seen it coming  
It was right behind your eyes  
You were young and it was summer  
I just had to take a dive  
When I knew was easy, the darkness was the price.  
  
I don't smoke no cigarette, I don't drink no alcohol  
I ain't had much loving yet  
But that's always been your call  
Hey I don't miss it baby  
I got no taste for anything at all  
  
I used to love the rainbow  
And I used to love the view  
Another early morning, I'd pretend that it was you  
But I caught the darkness baby  
And I got it worse than you  
  
I caught the darkness, it was drinking from your cup  
I caught the darkness, drinking from your cup

Ring out the bells upon this day of days!  
May all the angels of the Lord above  
In jubilation sing their songs of praise!  
And crown this blessed time with peace and love.  
  
[The procession becomes a dancing celebration. A waltz is played.]  
  
Major Domo  
The Baron and Baroness de Thenard wish to pay their  
Respects to the groom!  
  
Thenardier  
I forget where we met  
Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge  
Where the duke did that puke  
Down the Duchess's de-coll-etage?  
  
Marius  
No, 'Baron de Thenard'  
The circles I move in are humbler by far.  
Go away, Thenardier!  
Do you think I don't know who you are?  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
He's not fooled, told you so.  
Show M'sieur what you've come here to show.  
Tell the boy what you know!  
  
[Applause from the dancers as the waltz finishes.]  
  
Marius  
When I look at you, I remember Eponine  
She was more than you deserved, who gave her birth  
But now she is with God and happier, I hope  
Than here on earth!

Life has dealt me some terrible blows.

You could give us a bit of a start  
We can prove, plain as ink  
Your bride's father is not what you think.  
  
Thenardier  
There's a tale I could tell  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
Information we're willing to sell.  
  
Thenardier  
There's a man that he slew  
I saw the corpse clear as I'm seeing you!  
What I tell you is true!  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
Pity to disturb you at a feast like this  
But five hundred francs surely wouldn't come amiss.  
  
Marius  
In God's name say what you have to say.  
  
Thenardier  
But first you pay!  
  
What I saw, clear as light  
Jean Valjean in the sewers that night  
Had this corpse on his back  
Hanging there like a great bloody sack.  
I was there, never fear  
Even found me this fine souvenir!  
  
[Thenardier shows Marius a ring.]  
  
Marius  
I know this! This was mine!  
Surely this is some heavenly sign!  
  
Thenardier  
One more thing, mark this well  
It was the night the barricades fell.  
  
Marius  
Then it's true, then I'm right  
Jean Valjean was my savior that night!  
  
[Marius hits Thenardier and then throws money at him.]  
  
As for you, take this too!  
God forgive the things that we do.  
  
Come my love, come Cosette  
This day's blessings are not over yet!

I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches  
  
And I don't love them hoes  
Don't fuck up with Wayne 'cause when it ""Wayne's"" it pours  
No really, I'm on my ""fuck that bitch"" shit  
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch  
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though  
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon-toed  
She used to always say, fuck my niggas  
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas  
Well, I guess I'm single for the night  
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night  
And if I sound mad, then you caught me  
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me  
  
How to hate a bitch  
That owe you everything  
At least a wedding ring  
Moving on to better things  
So don't you call me talking 'bout them other fools  
I'm not good enough for you  
I thought that we was cool  
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen  
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches  
  
Coke in the Ciroc  
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot  
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top  
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock well  
And I wish I never met ya  
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better  
And all I had to do was put two and two together  
But that just makes four, but not four-ever, damn  
So much for being the perfect couple  
I put in overtime, I was working doubles  
I wish you the best, good luck boo  
Weezy F, for fuck you  
  
No ain't nothing going on  
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home  
Get away from here, girl I'm so glad you're gone  
This is the last song I'm writing for you  
Now I see how you can be  
I don't want you 'round me  
All you do is down me girl  
How many years I tried to get ya  
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya,  
'Cause girl you done taught me  
  
How to hate a bitch  
That owe you everything  
At least a wedding ring  
Moving on to better things  
So don't you call me talking 'bout them other fools

Linda Ronstadt,All I Left Behind,/l/linda+ronstadt/all+i+left+behind_20237469.html,"All I left behind should come as no surprise  
To me since I fell through the black hole of your eye  
Only little things inconsequential I could say  
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway  
Silver earrings in Wichita  
Beaded moccasins in Tonapah  
  
But I had you, so  
I just let them go  
The flannel shirt I wore to keep me from the cold  
When we drove from Boston all the way to Buffalo  
The leather boots I bought so many miles ago  
I took them off to follow you into the Ohio  
Never did my armor feel so thin  
  
Silk was all I had between me and your skin  
Like Waterloo, I lost that too  
And the gold bracelet with my father's name inscribed  
On the back by the one who loved him all her life  
The way I too could have loved you  
The Spanish shawl I put across the broken shade  
Of the lamp that lit the room  
  
That last night near Cour d'Alene  
Only little things inconsequential I could say  
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway  
Of all I left behind

Linkin Park,Enth E Nd,/l/linkin+park/enth+e+nd_10166032.html,"Hey yo when this first started off it was just Linkin Park...  
Then in the middle came Motion Man...  
And at the end of it all it was Kutmasta Kut wit a remix [echo]  
  
One thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time  
All I know, time was just slipping way  
  
And I watched it count down till the end of the day  
Watched it watch me and the words that I say  
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins  
I know that I didn't look out below  
  
And I watched the time go right out the window  
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch  
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock  
But in the end no matter what I pretend  
  
The journey is more important than the end or the start  
And what it meant to me will eventually be  
A memory of the time when I tried so hard  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time  
All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party  
  
All for shake and made eye contact  
Party control showing all that  
Northeast, southwest coast  
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle  
  
I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder  
I brought you back of the thing  
Like the imaginary man of your dreams  
Well, you would always seem to make it worth it  
  
A sleek skin I never nerved you  
You felt lovin, I never applied a room  
Without bringing the plan  
By any means and means of leaving you teens,  
Of all those teenage scenes, I tried so hard  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
I had to fall  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter

Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Motion Man  
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kurt  
  
One thing I don't know how  
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now  
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all  
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl  
  
And I was forced to run, with you mocking me  
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly  
Remembering all those times you fought with me  
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy  
  
And now your mouth wishes it could inhale  
Every single little thing you said and make it expel  
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't
matter to me  
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend  
  
The journey is more important than the end or the start  
And what it meant to me will eventually be  
A memory of the time when I tried so hard  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall  
  
To lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter..  
In the end

Guilt tearin' up my brain like erosion

I regret that I did it like a junkie when he's jonzin'  
All alone in what used to be a home  
But you packed up our joy in that bag you put your clothes in  
The voice mail that you left me was scoldin'  
Hot enough to burn a hole in a cauldron  
Cause it was all true, that's why we all through  
Now your girl's pickin' up the cell when I call you  
Talkin' slick like she ain't here  
She don't want you no more, punk disappear, click

And it don't feel nice, when you wake up nights

Swat teams whatever, tell 'em to send the hounds in

LL Cool J,The Boomin' System,/l/ll+cool+j/the+boomin+system_20084663.html,"Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumpin'  
  
Yeah alright  
But we need a beat that they can front to  
Oh, that'll work  
Be funky  
You know what I'm sayin'?  
  
(Cars ride by with the boomin systems)  
(Cars ride by)  
  
Funky  
For all the cars out there  
And all the brothers  
That like to front in their rides  
Check it out  
  
You know it's funky, funky, funky cos you heard it from hear-say  
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay  
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around  
12 o'clock at night with your windows down  
Headlights breakin' 'cause your batteries drain  
Armor all on your tires and a big gold chain  
Parkin' outside of all the hip-hop spots  
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots  
Leanin' to the side, people everywhere  
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare  
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back  
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack  
Cause they don't understand why I act this way  
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day  
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by  
And the girls be on my jock cos my system's fly  
  
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me  
Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently  
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this  
Mind your business  
Now pass it around  
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound  
People in the street see me bobbin my head  
While I'm checking out the rapper and the rhyme that he said  
I'm fronting, and I don't care if you know  
The backseat of my car is like a disco show  
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone  
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne  
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top  
Cruise, it's 3 o'clock  
The girlies, they smile, they see me coming  
I'm steady huming, I got the Funky Drumer druming  
My trunk be shaking, vibrating and rattling  
Pumping so loud, all the shorties be battling  
A right-hand man's here without the swing  
Every chance I get I'm showing off my rings  
I can keep it up until the break of dawn  
Cos I'm fronting in my ride and my word is bond  
  
Sun roof open, so I can feel the wind blow  
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window  
C to the o to the o to the l to the i to the n  
To the f to the r to the o to the 'n' to the t to the i to the n  
That means I'm chilling  
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed  
They recline way back, so I can get real cosy  
I got the gangster tapes in the place  
Like a base-head would say I want bass  
I want a hit, I want a dose  
You're rolling up smiling, but you can't come close  
Cos my system is pumping loud  
Like Rakim said I wanna move the crowd  
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE  
Tell the cops you gots to chill with EPMD  
This is something devastating that'll break your trunk  
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk  
  
You know what I'm saying  
Word  
So next time you're in your ride pumping it up  
Just remember  
It's Cool  
  
Peace

She says she loves me  
And I could always

To have her home  
She says she loves me  
She won't forget me  
And then she's gone  
She thinks that later  
We can pick up the pieces  
And carry on  
And I'd forgive her  
Still not suspecting  
She could be wrong  
Now I'm so grateful  
I'm no longer willing

We grew up together ever since we were nine  
We went to school, he was my best friend  
And I thought our friendship would never end  
  
In highschool he played football  
And me, I didn't do anything at all  
He made touch-downs, while I played pool  
And no one could figure out, which one of us was the fool  
  
Then we both went to collage  
He studied medicine, while I studied foilage  
He got ""A's"", and I got ""D's""  
He was going for his P.H.D.  
The I decided to drop out  
Then I decided to drop out  
Things were getting a little to hot  
  
Billy stayed there, became an intern, then a doctor  
Then war broke out and he had to go  
But not me, I was mentally unfit or so they say, so, so  
  
When he came back, he wasn't quite the same  
His nerves were shot, but not me  
Last time I saw him, I couldn't take it anymore  
He wasn't the Billy I knew, it was like talking to a door  
  
Billy was a friend of mine  
I grew up with him ever since we were nine  
We went together to school  
And now I often wonder, which one of us was the fool

Lou Reed,Endless Cycle,/l/lou+reed/endless+cycle_20085220.html,"The bias of the father runs on through the son  
And leaves him bothered and bewildered  
The drugs in his veins only cause him to spit  
At the face staring back in the mirror  
  
How can he tell a good act from the bad  
He can't even remember his name  
How can he do what needs to be done  
When he's a follower not a leader  
  
The sickness of the mother runs on through the girl  
Leaving her small and helpless  
Liquor files through her brain with the force of a gun  
Leaving her running in circles  
  
How can she tell a good act from the bad  
When she's flat on her back in her room  
How can she do what needs to be done  
When she's a coward and a bleeder  
  
The man if he marries will batter his child  
And have endless excuses  
The woman sadly will do much the same  
Thinking that it's right and it's proper  
  
Better than their mommy or their daddy did  
Better than the childhood they suffered  
The truth is they're happier when they're in pain  
In fact, that's why they got married

And now I can't see you  
You had your ashes scattered at sea  
There's no grave to visit, no tombstone to look at  
You were in the New York Times obituary  
There's no record, no tape, no book, no movie  
Some photographs and some memories  
Sometimes I dial your phone number by mistake  
And this is what I hear:  
This is no longer a working number, baby  
Please redial your call  
This is no longer a working number  
Your party doesn't live here anymore  
This is no longer a working number  
If you still require help  
Stay on the line, and an operator  
Will try to bail you out  
I knew I should have seen you that Thursday  
I knew I shouldn't have left  
But you sounded so good, your spirits so up  
I thought I'd see you next week  
I say over and over if I had half a brain  
If I had half a brain in my head  
I wouldn't sit here, dialing a wrong number  
And listening to what some recording said  
I knew I should have written, written things down  
I always say I'll never forget  
Who can forget a one-eyed pilot?  
Who's a concert pianist?  
A painter, a poet, songwriter supreme  
My friends are blending in my head  
They're melting into one great spirit  
And that spirit isn't dead  
Now, I may not remember everything that you said  
But I remember all the sings you've done  
And not a day goes by, not an hour  
When I don't try to be like you  
You were gassed, stoked, and rarin' to go  
And you were that way all the time  
So I guess you know why I'm laughing at myselves  
Every time I dial the wrong line

Many years ago  
To protect himself from being hurt again  
But he couldn' t stop his feelings  
Last night yeah  
When he saw the young lady in the bar  
Blonde hair, blue eyes  
Waited till the band played the last song  
And took her home  
His mother didn' t like her  
His father didn' t like her  
The only thing that kept them  
Going was knowing that  
Love would conquer all

They were lovers  
In a dangerous time  
  
They ran away to another country  
'Cause they thought things would be  
Better for them out there  
In the month of December  
They got married in Chicago  
And it was all the same  
Everywhere they went  
Heads would turn

No one will undermine my culture anymore,

Madonna,Joan Of Arc,/m/madonna/joan+of+arc_21092364.html,"[Verse 1]  
Each time they take the photograph  
I lose a part I can't get back  
I wanna hide  
This is the part where I detach  
Each time they write a hateful word  
Dragging my soul into the dirt  
I wanna die  
Never [?] hurts  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna talk about it right now  
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out  
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet  
But I'm in the dark, yeah  
I can't be superhero right now  
Even hearts made out of steel can break down  
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet  
I'm only human  
Anything they did to me, said to me  
Doesn't mean a thing cause you're here with me now  
Even when the world turns its back on me  
There could be a war but I'm not going down  
  
[Verse 2]  
One little lie can ruin my day  
Words are like weapons, they betray  
When I am afraid  
One word of kindness, it can save me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Being destructive is  
They couldn't say it to my face  
ONe day I won't care  
But for the moment I'm not there  
I'll just close my eyes and let you catch me now

Doesn't mean a thing cause you're here with me now

In the skies are like fireflies  
Burning bright, just to vanish in the dark  
  
I've held hope in my two hands  
That there would be another chance  
To find the kingdom, I'm believing in my heart  
Cause underneath the good there's something greater than you know  
  
When you're almost there  
And you're almost home  
Just open up your eyes and go, go  
When you're almost there, almost home  
Know you're not alone  
You're almost home  
  
When you run, run so far  
You've forgotten who you are  
Where you're from, it's like some other universe  
You count your steps, like they're regrets  
You catch one breath then lose the rest  
Wrong is right, right is left  
And there's nowhere left to turn  
  
So don't believe in everything  
You think, you think you know  
  
When you're almost there  
And you're almost home  
Just open up your eyes and go, go  
When you're almost there, almost home  
Know you're not alone  
You're almost home  
  
When you let your heart be the compass  
You won't get lost, not if you trust it  
When you hear the sound of the trumpet  
Louder than ever before  
  
Oh, when you're almost there  
Almost home  
Just open up your eyes and go, go  
Cause you're almost there  
Almost home  
Know you're not alone  
You're almost home  
  
When you're almost there  
Almost home  
Just open up your eyes and go, go  
Almost there  
You're almost home

Marianne Faithfull,Mad About The Boy,/m/marianne+faithfull/mad+about+the+boy_20088744.html,"I met him at a party just a couple of years ago,  
He was rather over-hearty and ridiculous  
But as I'd seen him on the screen he cast a certain spell.  
I'd basked in his attraction  
For a couple of hours or so.  
His manners were a fraction too meticulous,  
If he was real or not, I couldn't tell,  
But like a silly fool I fell  
  
Mad about the boy,  
I know it's stupid  
To be mad about the boy.  
I'm so ashamed of it  
But must admit  
The sleepless nights  
I've had about the boy.  
  
On the silver screen  
He melts my foolish heart  
In every single scene.  
Although I'm quite aware  
That here and there  
Are traces of that cared about the boy.  
Lord knows I'm not a fool girl,  
I really shouldn't care.  
Lord knows I'm not a schoolgirl  
In the flurry of her first affair.  
Will it ever cloy  
This odd diversity of misery and joy  
I'm feeling quite insane  
And young again  
And all because  
I'm mad about the boy.  
  
It seems a little silly  
For a girl of my age and weight  
To walk down piccadilly in a haze of light.  
It ought to take her a good deal more  
To take a bad girl down.  
I should've been exempt for my particular kind of fate  
As taught me such contempt for every phase of love  
And now I've been and spent my love torn crown  
To weep about a painted clown.  
  
Mad about the boy,  
It's pretty funny  
But I'm mad about the boy.  
He has a gay appeal that makes me feel  
There's maybe something sad about the boy.  
  
Walking down the street  
His eyes look out at me from people that I meet.  
I can't believe it's true,  
But when I'm blue, in some strange way  
I'm glad about the boy.  
  
I'm hardly sentimental,  
Love isn't so sublime.  
I have to pay my rental  
And I can't afford to waste much time.  
If I could employ a little magic  
That would finally destroy  
This dream that pains me and it shames me  
But I can't because I'm mad about the boy.

Wanna to see the tears tumble down  
Show me I meant something  
And that you feel nothing  
But your world crashing to the ground  
It's so easy for you  
To forget about me

From across the sea  
It lingered there touched your hair  
And walked with me  
  
All summer long  
We sang a song  
And then we strolled on golden sand  
Two sweethearts  
And the summer wind  
  
Like painted kites, those days and nights  
Went flying by  
The world was new  
Beneath the bright blue  
Umbrella sky  
  
Then softer than  
A piper man  
One day, it called to you  
I lost you to  
The summer wind  
  
The autumn wind  
And the winter wind  
They have come and gone  
But still those days  
Those lonely days  
Go on and on  
And guess who sighs his lullabies  
Through nights that never end?  
My fickle friend,  
The summer wind  
  
Umm... That summer wind.  
Warm warm summer wind  
Umm... That summer wind.

That we're going to keep growing, wait and see.  
  
When all the stars are falling down  
Into the sea and on the ground,  
And angry voices carry on the wind,  
A beam of light will fill your head  
And you'll remember what's been said  
By all the good men this world's ever known.  
Another man is what you'll see,  
Who looks like you and looks like me,  
And yet somehow he will not feel the same,  
His life caught up in misery, he doesn't think like you and me,  
'Cause he can't see what you and I can see.

Moody Blues,Twilight Time,/m/moody+blues/twilight+time_20485201.html,"Twilight time to dream awhile,  
In veils of deepening blue.  
As fantasy strides, over colourfull skies,  
Of form disappearing from view.  
  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
  
A nightingale plays a dark mellow phrase,  
Of notes that are rich and so true.  
An aerial display by the firefly brigade,  
Dancing to tunes no one knew.  
  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
  
Building castles in the air,  
Whistling to the wind.  
As nature bows down her head,  
See what tomorrow brings.  
  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
  
Bats take to wing like puppets on string,  
Prancing through cool evening air.  
In a sightless glide, no reason to hide  
Away from the sun's blinding stare.  
  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.

Ever since I heard the words that made me cry  
There's love in shadows waiting to be seen  
  
I'm waking for the first time, waking for the first time  
Waking for the very first time to a dream  
  
I'm getting a feeling that I want to explore  
My heart to the ceiling and my feet off the floor  
You let in all the magic  
  
Oh It's even better than before  
You open your heart and then you oprn the door  
I'm getting all the magic

Lift up your dress and walk away

About the good old days we had  
Your face grows longer as you crumble  
You had the good now taste the bad  
Let it all hit the fan  
Let it all hit the fan  
You promised me nothing would change you  
More empty words from an empty soul  
The same old stories you still cling to  
The truth be told you leave me cold  
You used to lead the dance and fumble  
Howl in the night you could not sleep  
You climbed to the top of the hill then tumbled  
Too many promises come cheap.

Searchin' for an answer  
Hopin' there's a chance  
That she'll be comin' back to me  
Midnight dream  
I'm waitin' on the mountain  
Thinkin' I can find her  
Maybe if I find her,  
Here is where she'll want to be  
Midnight dream  
I made my way down to Mexico  
I spend a year travelin' 'cross the ocean  
Without goin' anywhere  
A hundred miles to the nearest phone  
A thousand miles from a place called home  
And all alone in my despair  
I'd call you there  
My midnight dream  
So I'm sittin' on a mountain  
Lookin' 'cross a river  
Needin' to be with her  
More than I believed I'd be  
Midnight dream  
I'm sittin' all alone now  
Knowin' what I know now  
Thought I'd be a teacher  
But she would end up teachin' me  
Midnight dream  
I know that I lost my way one night  
But if you ask me  
It don't seem right  
To spend my life without you there  
And so I climbed to the highest peak  
Just hopin' somehow that I what I seek  
Will somehow speak and you'll appear  
My midnight dream  
Where are you, don't let go  
So I'm sittin' on a mountain  
How can I explain it  
I'm livin' with the pain of thinkin' how it  
Still could be  
Midnight dream  
Love is what I'm thinkin'  
No two ways about it  
Go too long without it,  
Nothing really means a thing  
Midnight dream  
But if you haven't decided yet  
Might be the only chance we get  
Let's don't forget 'bout you and me  
I finally ended where I began  
You see before you  
The sorry soul, the lonely man  
I've come to be  
Please come to me

Oh come to me

In the heat of an evening  
When only prisoners sleep  
She said she couldn't  
Come to the garden  
See an old man wheel  
  
She said her dreams  
What too far to be thought of  
As scars too white to view  
She said she couldn't  
Come to the garden  
See a blind man kneel  
  
She sailed away  
To a blue horizon  
In floating thoughts she'd sway  
She said she couldn't  
Come to the garden  
See an old man pray  
  
She wished them luck  
As they left on their journey  
Maybe she'd join them soon  
But she lost her grip  
At the tip of life's finger  
Went home and worshiped the moon

It's seven o'clock and I want to rock  
Want to get a belly full of beer  
  
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of Winos  
And my old lady she don't care  
My sister's looking cute in her braces and boots  
A handful of grease in her hair  
  
Don't give us none of your aggravation  
We had it with your discipline  
Saturday night's alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this town alight  
Saturday night's the night I like  
Saturday night's alright alright alright  
  
They're packed pretty tight in here tonight  
I'm looking for a woman to treat me right  
I could use a little muscle to get what I need  
I'll drink a fifth of jack and scream out ""She's with me!""  
  
A couple of the sound that I really like  
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike  
I'm a juvenile product of the working class  
Whose best friend floats from the bottom of a glass

And now the people are talking, the people are saying that you have been
playing my heart like a grand piano

Oh Christ, how I hate what I have become  
Take me home  
  
Get away, run away, fly away

Whose guiding light chose you  
Chose you all

I know I will die alone, but loved  
You live long enough to hear the sound of guns  
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night  
And if you want  
Live long enough to see your friends betray you  
Years have I been strapped unto this altar  
Now I only have three minutes and counting  
I just wish the tide would catch me first  
And give me a death  
I always longed for  
  
Second robber to the right of Christ  
Cut in half - infacticide  
The world will rejoice today  
As the crows feast on the rotting poet  
  
Everyone must bury their own  
No pack to bury the heart of stone  
Now he's home in Hell, serves him well  
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell  
  
The morning dawned upon this altar  
Remains of the dark passion play  
Performed by his friends without shame  
Spitting on his grave as they came  
  
Get away, run away, fly away  
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway

The music he wrote had too long been without silence

With a smile in his face, a pen and 1000 pages of erased text  
  
Save me!

Try to save them all, bleed no more  
You have such ocean's within  
In the end

The thrill should have been all gone by today, in the usual way,  
But it's only your arms that I'm out of.  
What a fool to dream of you,  
To sigh and tell you that I love you,  
But now I'm playing it, now I'm playing it dumb,  
I can't get out of this mood,  
Heartbreak, heartbreak here I come.

And it's Easter time too  
And your gravity fails  
And negativity don't pull you through  
  
Don't put on any airs  
When you're down on rue morgue avenue  
They got some hungry women there  
And they really make a mess out of you  
  
Now if you see Saint Annie  
Please tell her thanks a lot  
I cannot move  
My fingers are all in a knot  
  
I don't have the strength  
To get up and take another shot  
And my best friend my doctor  
Won't even say what it is I have got

She speaks good English  
And she invites you up into her room  
  
And you're so kind  
And careful not to go to her too soon  
And she takes your voice  
And leaves you howling at the moon  
  
Up on housing project hill  
It's either fortune or fame  
You must pick one or the other  
Though neither of them  
  
Are to be what they claim  
If you're looking to get silly  
You better go back from where you came  
Because the cops don't need you  
And man they expect the same  
  
Now all the authorities  
They just stand around and boast  
Hew they blackmailed the sergeant at arms  
Into leaving his post  
  
And picking up angel who  
Just arrived here from the coast  
Who looked so fine at first  
But left looking like a ghost  
  
I started out on burgundy  
But soon hit the harder stuff  
Everybody said they'd stand behind me  
When the game got rough  
  
But the joke was on me  
There was nobody even there to bluff  
I'm going back to New York City  
I do believe I've had enough

In the sun the garbage stinking.  
To ignore the rancid, won't make it go away.

Unclean thoughts that take the step,  
Down upon the roaches,  
Won't go away.  
  
Born! to follow!  
To be the first to swallow,  
Garbage from the plate.  
Now! to borrow!  
A match, ignite the gasoline,  
To burn away.  
  
Surviving through a gasoline dream,  
In the month the razon blade gleam,  
Slashing up the tongue, won't make it go away.  
On a binge of self destruction,  
  
Children of the reconstruction,  
Suck the tit of discontent,  
Go away.

Don't go away.

Playin' with a match.

Ate from your table!  
Ate from your hand!  
Eight days of waiting!  
Buried in the sand!

Burn away the conscience, burn away, my love.  
Take away my dignity, take away my pain,  
Take just for taking, we are one in the same...

Burn in a gasoline dream, burn away my love.  
Burn away the conscience, burn away, my love.

Go back to my old neighborhood

Then I'd go over to my neighbor's house  
Knock on the door 'n they'd all sing out  
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
  
I'd sing their praises long and loud  
Cause their all my folks and I'm mighty proud  
Of the little old town back home where I was born  
I wish that I could hear them say  
In the good old-fashioned, friendly way  
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
  
Well, they don't lock their doors at night  
'Cause they all know they're a-doin' right  
And the good lord's bound to have them for his own  
If I'd go back to hear them pray  
In the little pine church, they all would say  
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
  
When I was a child of only three  
I said my prayers at my mother's knee  
And I knew right then from god I'd never roam  
When I get my summons on the judgment day  
I hope I can hear my savior say  
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
Now, come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

Your family rented this apartment  
You'd watch the street lamps from your perch  
In the sacramental house your stepfather in black  
Preached the fire of the pentecostal church.  
  
No one knows you like I do  
Nobody can know your heart the way i do  
No one can testify to all that you've been through  
But this will.  
  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
Came here when I was a child.  
Small change and sunlight, then I left these streets for good.  
My days as short as they were wild.  
  
I'm Frenchy Cordero, I'm Angel Soto  
Indio Rivera, 'Baboo' Charlie Cruz  
The faces blurred in every grainy photo  
And fading headline of the Daily News  
  
Judge's Voice  
Wiltwych School for Criminal Children  
Auburn, Brooklyn House of D.,  
Dannemora, Sing-Sing, Attica,  
Greenhaven  
  
Twenty years inside, today you're free  
  
You cannot even read your story  
The pages piling up in shame  
Before the words released you, the  
Guard would kill the light  
The night you took The Capeman for your name.  
  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
Yo nacir in Puerto Rico  
All my heart is Puerto Rico  
All my soul is Puerto Rico

No, no, not really.

Past the shadows dark and deep  
My mind dances and leaps in confusion.  
I don't know what is real,  
I can't touch what I feel  
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion.  
So I'll continue to continue to pretend  
My life will never end,  
And Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall.  
The mirror on my wall  
Casts an image dark and small  
But I'm not sure at all it's my reflection.  
I am blinded by the light  
Of God and truth and right  
  
And I wander in the night without direction.  
So I'll continue to continue to pretend  
My life will never end,  
And Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall.  
It's no matter if you're born  
To play the King or pawn  
For the line is thinly drawn 'tween joy and sorrow,  
So my fantasy  
Becomes reality,  
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow.  
So I'll continue to continue to pretend  
My life will never end,

In the creases and the shadows  
With a rattling deep emotion  
The cool, cool river  
Sweeps the wild, white ocean  
  
Yes Boss. The government handshake  
Yes Boss. The crusher of language  
Yes Boss. Mr. Stillwater,  
The face at the edge of the banquet  
The cool, the cool river

I may live in my car  
My radio tuned to  
The voice of a star  
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn  
Lightning pushes the edge of a thunderstorm  
And these old hopes and fears  
Still at my side  
  
Anger and no one can heal it  
Slides through the metal detector  
Lives like a mole in a motel  
A slide in a slide projector  
The cool, cool river  
Sweeps the wild, white ocean  
The rage of love turns inward  
To prayers of devotion  
And these prayers are  
The constant road across the wilderness  
These prayers are  
These prayers are the memory of God  
The memory of God  
  
And I believe in the future  
We shall suffer no more  
Maybe not in my lifetime  
But in yours I feel sure  
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn  
Lightning pushes the edges of a thunderstorm  
And these streets  
Quiet as a sleeping army  
Send their battered dreams to heaven, to heaven  
For the mother's restless son  
Who is a witness to, who is a warrior  
Who denies his urge to break and run  
  
Who says: Hard times?  
I'm used to them  
The speeding planet burns  
I'm used to that  
My life's so common it disappears  
And sometimes even music  
Cannot substitute for tears

She's beautiful, but she's too young to be caught

Trying to steer you away from me

We are time zones and oceans apart  
The words I speak in the middle of my night  
Fall on your yesterday's heart  
  
If the sun don't shine  
If the wind don't break  
If the clock don't jump off the wall  
Thelma, my darlin', I will cushion your fall  
  
I will need you, feed you,  
Seed you, plead with you  
Without the taste of your sweet love, Thelma  
I am only a man who skirted the edge of despair  
For a long time, now  
And I don't care  
  
I watch you sleeping in the hospital bed  
The baby curled up in a ball  
Winter sunlight hits the family tree  
And everything else becomes nothing at all

Darkness that is endless  
Nights that leave me friendless, blue

Just like me you're faded, jaded and degraded, too  
Why must you send  
Ebony moonbeams, depressing, distressing  
Like shadows of love that are gone  
  
Where will it end  
Will it spread on to the starlight, the sunlight  
And darken each promise of dawn

Madly, I await you, even though I hate you

Her shit started to sag, she got surgery  
Now cats are used to drive past her like a Church van  
Acting on thirst, 'She Wants To Move' like a N. E. Are. D. Fan  
Bigger house, 10, 000 dollar purse fam  
She let you in, she wanted rent by the 1st man  
She the ring leader in a clique of birds  
And they shadowy, like the silhouette behind the curtain  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse - Talib Kweli]  
She was a small city girl with big city dreams  
Niggaz try to figure how to get up in them jeans  
Put her in them scenes, get her on the team  
Hit her wit the cream 'til they figured out the schemes  
Now she all up in the club looking for a new love  
Really like Huey Lewis looking for a new drug  
Cause coke's getting old, started free basing  
Graduated to crack, smack on occasion  
Not catching the bus, but back at the station  
Back and forth pacing, acting all impatient  
Last hundred dollars, she got to 'Get By'  
Now gotta make a choice, go home or get high  
Mommy and daddy miss her, she left for the fame  
Now what's left is the dirt that's thrown on her name  
She need a ticket home if it's the right course  
Instead she bought a ticket to ride the white horse  
  
[Chorus:]

Only if you're clean and the lads are not uptight  
Or you may as well forget it until the broad daylight  
In the big city, where the suits don't look you in the eye  
Learn how to laugh, you'll be plannin' when to die  
Don't expect favours when the cars go passing by  
I lost my girl waitin' for the train from Ride  
Well, I don't mind matching colours or parkin' people's cars  
And telling little lies if that's alright  
In the big city, in the big city, in the big city  
In the big city, in the big city, in the big city

Turned into a heaven-sent message that saved your ass from dyin'

And if you're lost they won't show you the way""  
That same somebody said ""I'd dig you better dead  
But I'd much rather see if your God is what you say, say, say""  
  
And with the awesome power they struck  
1st they offered up the buck  
Right in the middle, right in the middle they stuck (right in the middle)  
A toke or to, what the fuck? (what the fuck?)

Queen Latifah,Fly Girl,/q/queen+latifah/fly+girl_10237192.html,"Well it's almost nightfall  
And there's no forecast of rainfall  
And I'm in the mood for a party  
So I'm gonna go out to a club  
And give the dancefloor body  
So I jump in the car and go to the venue  
Walk in the door and now I'm on the menu  
Guys in the house they're wacthing me  
They're clocking me there's no stopping me  
  
(Desire) I know you want me  
(You're fine) thank you  
But I'm not the type of girl that you think I am  
I don't jump into the arms of every man  
(But I'm paid) I don't need your money  
(I love you) you must be mad  
Easy lover is something that I ain't  
Besides, I don't know you from a can of paint  
  
Tell me why is it when I walk past the guys  
I always hear, yo, baby?  
I mean like what's the big idea?  
I'm a queen, nuff respect  
Treat me like a lady  
And, no, my name ain't yo and I ain't got your baby  
I'm looking for a guy who's sincere  
One with class and savoir faire  
I'm looking for someone who has to be  
Perfect for the queen latifah me  
  
Fly girl, fly girl  
Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine  
And I want you to be mine  
Fly girl, fly girl  
Have no fear, your heart is in good hands  
Won't you let me be your man?  
  
All my friends are in relationships  
Some of then good ones and some of them bad ones  
Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better  
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones  
You see? loving, it ain't hard to get  
I want a friend not just a lover  
Someone who is dedicated only to me  
Not to me and two or three others  
One who will not lie to me or think  
He can get my love by buying me  
I know I'll find him some day  
And when I find him  
He sure won't say  
  
Fly girl, fly girl  
Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine  
And I want you to be mine  
Fly girl, fly girl, have no fear  
Have no fear, your heart is in good hands  
Won't you let me be your man?  
  
Lounging, sitting in the house  
And I'm cooling, first day of the week  
So there's nothing to do  
And I'm in the mood for a real soft kiss  
Momma never said there'll be days like this  
So I called her and we talked for a while  
Hang up the phone feeling better  
With a smile  
  
It's cool, 'cause 91 is my year  
And this time I know I'm gonna hear  
  
Fly girl, fly girl, come here  
Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine  
And I want you to be mine  
Fly girl, fly girl  
Have no fear, your heart is in good hands  
Won't you let me be your man?

To every city  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
Every hood  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
And every block  
Ghetto America!  
  
Rollin' through the hood  
Just stopped by to say what's up  
And let you know  
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough  
And even though you passed  
Going on four long years  
Still waking up late at night crying tears  
Just thinking about those days  
You used to talk to me  
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey  
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be  
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'  
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half  
I would give it all up, just to take one ride  
  
(With you)  
How I used to kick it on the front porch  
(With you)  
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed  
(With you)  
And all the little basement party joints we'd do  
Now I'm just missing you  
How I wish

I wish that I could touch you now  
I wish that I could talk to you  
Be with you somehow  
I know you're in a better place  
Even though I can't see your face  
I know you're smiling down on me  
Saying everything's okay  
And if I make it out this thug life  
I'll see you again someday  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
I wish, I wish, I wish  
  
Now ever since this money come  
It's been nothing but stress  
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success  
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed  
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness  
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton  
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun  
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now  
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house  
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits  
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em  
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around  
But y'all don't want to raise the roof  
Until my shit is going down  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'  
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half  
I would give it all up, just to take one ride  
  
(With you)  
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments  
(With you)  
And how I used to club hop on weekends  
(With you)  
Your family called the morning of the tragic end  
Damn, my condolences  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church  
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt  
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse  
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst  
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man  
And I try to keep it real with my homies now  
For me to save the world I don't understand  
How did I become the leader of a billion men?  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'  
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half  
I would give it all up, just to take one ride  
  
(With you)  
How I used to street perform on Friday  
(With you)  
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday  
(With you)  
Standing here throwing them songs at me  
Somebody pray for me

I've been kicking it with your girlfriend  
Oh what am I gonna do?  
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you  
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth  
I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced  
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end  
Baby, I've been kicking it with your girlfriend  
  
Go ahead and slap me again, cause I can understand how you feel  
When a man takes you for granted and he don't keep it real  
I should've been a man and told you a long time ago  
Instead of stunning I should have broke it down and let you know  
Girl my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind  
And I blame myself for wasting your time  
Believe, I really did try to keep that girl away from me  
But her body language kept on temping and teasing me  
And plus she knew what she was doing when she did it anyway  
I knew what she was doing too and that made it okay  
Truth is that we don't even regret it  
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down  
These are the reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around  
I just didn't know how to tell you that I was feelin her  
And how we get away sometimes and make love  
I never wanted to dislead you  
At first I just wanted to please you  
I know it's hard for you to be able to trust again  
Because I came between you and your best friend  
I did not ask for this  
It just happened outta no where since the day we kissed  
And the truth is that we don't even regret it  
Up out the closet, I will be the first to say it

I'm sorry again  
Never meant to hurt you

There was nothing good  
And in that very moment  
When it seemed all hope was lost  
I said, I plead the blood of Jesus  
And his death upon the cross  
Chorus:  
One drop of blood  
Fell to the scales  
It covered my transgressions  
And all the times I failed  
The enemy was mighty  
He came in like a flood  
He was defeated by one drop of blood  
I stood and watched in silence  
As others were brought in  
I saw them start to tremble  
When they turned and faced their sin  
They offered no excuses  
They offered no alibis  
The truth was overwhelming  
And it would not be denied  
Their righteousness like filthy rags  
And nothing they could say  
They bowed their heads in silence  
As they were led away  
But for the true believers  
Each time it was the same  
His glory shown around them  
As they called upon his name  
One drop of blood  
Fell to the scales  
It covered their transgressions  
And all the times they failed  
The enemy was mighty  
He came in like a flood  
He was defeated by one drop of blood  
No greater sacrifice has any other made  
Oh yes he paid the price  
With every drop he gave  
Chorus (repeat 2X)  
1996 Shepherd Boy Musicascap (adm. By Word Music) and Weedom

On the street last night  
She seemed so glad to see me  
I just smiled  
And we talked about some old times  
And we drank ourselves some beers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Still crazy after all these years  
  
I'm not the kind of man  
Who tends to socialize  
I seem to lean on  
Old familiar ways  
And I ain't no fool for love songs  
That whisper in my ears  
Still crazy after all these years  
Still crazy after all these years  
  
Four in the morning  
Crapped out  
Yawning  
Longing my life away  
I'll never worry  
Why should l?  
Its all gonna fade  
  
Now I sit by my window  
And I watch the cars  
I fear I'll do some damage  
One fine day  
But I would not be convicted  
By a jury of my peers  
Still crazy  
Still crazy  
Still crazy after all these years

Reliving how it used to be  
At a table for two just you and me  
But talking to an empty chair  
And laughing right out loud  
Turned everybody's head and left no doubt

With teardrops in my eyes  
And here I am alone starting to realize  
That my days would be brighter  
If I could learn to hide  
The feeling that I have for you  
Keeps hurting me inside  
  
Then my days begin  
With simple thoughts of you  
Hoping that tomorrow will be me and you  
Sharing dreams with each other  
And making them come true  
Holding one another, saying all ""I need is you""  
  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care  
Say when I need you  
You will always be there  
But if you go and leave me  
This I swear is true  
My love will always be with you  
  
Now my nights would end  
With just one wish, that's you  
To hold me in the dark  
And help me make it through  
'Cause the pain that's inside me  
Would simply melt away  
If I had you here with me  
And promise me you'd stay  
  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care  
Say when I need you  
You will always be there

It shines, through sin and sorrow's night  
To guide us to our God.  
  
Oh! haste to follow where it leads  
The gracious call obey  
Be rugged wilds, or flowery meads  
The Christian's destined way.

While light and grace are given  
Who meekly follow Christ on earth  
Shall reign with Him in Heaven...

Sung by flaming tongues above  
Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it  
Mount of Thy redeeming love.  
  
Here I raise mine Ebenezer  
Hither by Thy help I'm come  
And I hope by Thy good pleasure  
Safely to arrive at home  
Jesus sought me when a stranger  
Wandering from the fold of God  
He, to rescue me from danger  
Interposed His precious blood.

Daily I'm constrained to be  
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter  
Bind my wandering heart to Thee  
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it

Seal it for Thy courts above...

With reverent step and slow.  
  
Those little lanes, they have not changed,  
A sweet peace fills the air.  
I walked today where Jesus walked,  
And felt His presence there.  
  
My pathway led through Bethlehem,  
Ah memorys ever sweet.  
The little hills of Galilee,  
That knew His childish feet.  
  
The Mount of Olives, hallowed scenes,  
That Jesus knew before  
I saw the mighty Jordan roll,  
As in the days of yore.  
  
I knelt today where Jesus knelt,  
Where all alone he prayed.  
The Garden of Gethsemane,  
My heart felt unafraid.  
  
I picked my heavy burden up,  
And with Him at my side,  
I climbed the Hill of Calvary,  
I climbed the Hill of Calvary,  
I climbed the Hill of Calvary,  
Where on the Cross He died!  
  
I walked today where Jesus walked,

When I'm feeling weak  
And my pain walks down a one way street  
I look above  
And I know I'll always be blessed with love  
And as the feeling grows  
She breathes flesh to my bones  
And when love is dead  
I'm loving angels instead  
  
And through it all she offers me protection  
A lot of love and affection  
Whether I'm right or wrong  
And down the waterfall  
Wherever it may take me  
I know that life won't break me  
When I come to call she won't forsake me

Combed my hair in a thousand ways, but I came out lookin' just the same  
Daddy said, son, you better see the world  
I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave  
But remember one thing, don't lose your head to a woman that'll spend your
bread  
So I got out  
  
Paris was a place you could hide away, if you felt you didn't fit in  
French police wouldn't give me no peace, they claimed I was a nasty person  
Down along the left bank, minding my own  
Was knocked down by a human stampede  
Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot, when all I wanted was a cup of tea  
I was accused  
  
I moved on  
Down in rome I wasn't getting enough  
Of the things that keep a young man alive  
My body stunk, but I kept my funk at a time when I was right out of luck  
Getting desperate, indeed I was looking like a tourist attraction  
Oh, my dear, I better get out of here for the vatican don't give no sanction  
I wasn't ready for that, no, no  
  
I moved right out east, yeah  
On the peking ferry I was feeling merry, sailing on my way back here  
I fell in love with a slant-eyed lady by the light of an eastern moon  
Shanghai lil never used the pill, she claimed that it just ain't natural  
She took me up on deck and bit my neck  
Oh, people, I was glad I found her  
Oh, yeah, I was glad I found here  
  
I firmly believed that I didn't need anyone but me  
I sincerely thought I was so complete  
Look how wrong you can be  
The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe  
They wouldn't give you the time of day  
But the slant-eyed lady knocked me off my feet  
God, I was glad I found her  
  
And if they had the words I could tell to you  
To help you on your way down the road  
I couldn't quote you no dickens, shelley or keats  
'Cause it's all been said before  
Make the best out of the bad, just laugh it off  
You didn't have to come here anyway, so remember

In the common sense of human curiosity  
Destroy the entire world and get every man and woman out of nowhere  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look out for everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere  
  
People use their super-human powers to discover the dark and dangerous world  
Of hypothetical secrets  
In most cases, sometimes he or she confess why they regret  
In my opinion, gubernatorial fear is far from over  
The conspiracy is nowhere beyond our greatest self-destructive endeavor  
More and more human beings make connections  
And it's part of an all-out worldwide chain reaction  
Keep staring at the annihilation gun before it's too late  
One year from now, the entire world's about to detonate  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look out for everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere  
  
All nations will self-destruct, according to research scientists  
The bomb will explode in many countries where nuclear weapons exist  
Search for the enemy within your secret human desire  
Stare at the fugutives caught in the crossfire  
Stare at the anti-terrorsts standing higher  
Look at the dangerous cheaters taking a stand  
Nuclear detours fall pass the right human hand  
Find one or more anti-terrorism activist fighting for freedom  
Be sure the hidden enemy will escape from the kingdom  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere

Rush,Anthem,/r/rush/anthem_20119900.html,"Know your place in life is where you want to be  
Don't let them tell you that you owe it all to me  
Keep on looking forward, no use in looking 'round  
Hold your head above the ground and they won't bring you down  
  
Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind  
A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind  
We marvel after those who sought  
New wonders in the world, wonders in the world,  
Wonders in the world they wrought  
  
Live for yourself, there's no one else  
More worth living for  
Begging hands and bleeding hearts will  
Only cry out for more  
  
Well, I know they've always told you  
Selfishness was wrong  
Yet it was for me, not you, I  
Came to write this song

Rush,Cygnus X-1 Book II,/r/rush/cygnus+x+1+book+ii_20803542.html,"When our weary world was young  
The struggle of the ancients first began  
The Gods of love and reason  
Sought alone to rule the fate of man  
  
They battled through the ages  
But still neither force would yield  
The people were divided  
Every soul a battlefield  
Every soul a battlefield  
  
I bring truth and understanding  
I bring wit and wisdom fair  
Precious gifts beyond compare  
  
We can build a world of wonder  
I can make you all aware  
I will find you food and shelter  
Show you fire to keep you warm  
Through the endless winter storm  
  
You can live in grace and comfort  
In the world that you transform  
  
The people were delighted  
Coming forth to claim their prize  
They ran to build their cities  
And converse among the wise  
  
But one day the streets fell silent  
Yet they knew not what was wrong  
They urge to build these fine things  
Seemed not to be so strong  
  
The wise men were consulted  
And the bridge of death was crossed  
In quest of Dionysus  
To find out what they had lost  
  
I bring love to give you solace  
In the darkness of the night  
In the heart's eternal light  
  
You need only trust your feelings  
Only love can steer you right  
  
I bring laughter, I bring music  
I bring joy and I bring tears  
I will soothe your primal fears  
  
Throw off those chains of reason  
And your prison disappears  
  
The cities were abandoned  
And the forests echoed song  
They danced and lived as brothers  
They knew love could not be wrong  
  
Food and wine they had aplenty  
And they slept beneath the stars  
The people were contented  
And the Gods watched from afar  
  
But the winter fell upon them  
And it caught them unprepared  
Bringing wolves and cold starvation  
And the hearts of men despaired  
  
The universe divided  
As the heart and mind collided  
With the people left unguided  
For so many troubled years  
In a cloud of doubts and fears  
Their world was torn asunder  
Into hollow hemispheres  
  
Some fought themselves, some fought each other  
Most just followed one another  
Lost aimless like their brothers  
For their hearts were so unclear  
And the truth could not appear  
Their spirits were divided  
Into blinded hemispheres  
  
Some who did not fight  
Brought tales of old to light  
My Rocinante sailed by night  
On her final flight  
  
To the heart of Cygnus fearsome force  
We set our course  
Spiraled through that timeless space  
To this immortal race  
  
I have memory and awareness  
But I have no shape or form  
As a disembodied spirit  
I am dead and yet unborn  
I have passed into Olympus  
As was told in tales of old  
To the city of immortals  
Marble white and purest gold  
  
I see the Gods in battle rage on high  
Thunderbolts across the sky  
I cannot move, I cannot hide  
I feel a silent scream begin inside  
  
Then all at once the chaos ceased  
A stillness fell, a sudden peace  
The warriors felt my silent cry  
And stayed their struggle mystified  
  
Apollo was astonished  
Dionysus thought me mad  
But they heard my story further  
And they wondered and were sad  
  
Looking down from Olympus  
On a world of doubt and fear  
It's surface splintered  
Into sorry hemispheres  
  
They sat a while in silence  
Then they turned at last to me  
(We will call you Cygnus)  
(The God of balance you shall be)  
  
We can walk our road together  
If our goals are all the same  
We can run alone and free  
If we pursue a different aim  
  
Let the truth of love be lighted  
Let the love of truth shine clear sensibility  
Armed with sense and liberty  
With the heart and mind united  
In a single, perfect, sphere

When something broke the surface  
Just to see the starry dome  
We still feel that relation  
When the water takes us home  
In the flying spray of the ocean  
The water takes you home  
  
Springing from the weight  
Of the mountains  
Like the heart of the earth  
Would burst  
Flowing out from marble fountains  
In the dreams of a desert thirst  
  
Something swam through  
The jungles  
Where the mighty rivers roam  
Something breaks the silence  
When the water takes you home  
I hear the wordless voices  
When the water takes me home  
  
Waves that crash on the shoreline  
Torrents of tropical rain  
Streaming down  
Beyond our memory  
Streaming down inside our veins  
  
When something left the ocean  
To crawl high above the foam  
We still feel that elation  
When the water takes us home  
In a driving rain of redemption  
The water takes me home...

In geometric order  
An insulated border  
In between the bright lights  
And the far unlit unknown  
  
Growing up it all seems so one-sided  
Opinions all provided  
The future pre-decided  
Detached and subdivided  
In the mass production zone  
  
Nowhere is the dreamer  
Or the misfit so alone  
  
Subdivisions  
In the high school halls  
In the shopping malls  
Conform or be cast out  
Subdivisions  
In the basement bars  
In the backs of cars  
Be cool or be cast out  
Any escape might help to smooth  
The unattractive truth  
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe  
The restless dreams of youth  
  
Drawn like moths we drift into the city  
The timeless old attraction  
Cruising for the action  
Lit up like a firefly  
Just to feel the living night  
  
Some will sell their dreams for small desires  
Or lose the race to rats  
Get caught in ticking traps  
And start to dream of somewhere  
To relax their restless flight  
  
Somewhere out of a memory  
Of lighted streets on quiet nights

The hours tick away - they tick away

The way you live, the gifts that you give

With only a moment between

Just as hate knows love's the cure  
You can rest your mind assure  
That I'll be loving you always  
  
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow  
But in passing will grow older every day  
Just as all that's born is new  
You know what I say is true  
That I'll be loving you always  
  
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)  
Always  
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)  
Always  
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)  
Always  
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)  
  
Did you know that true love asks for nothing  
No no her acceptance is the way we pay  
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee  
To last through forever and another day  
  
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning  
And the seasons know exactly when to change  
Just as kindness knows no shame  
Know through all your joy and pain  
That I'll be loving you always  
  
As today I know I'm living  
But tomorrow could make me the past  
But that I mustn't fear  
For I'll know deep in my mind  
The love of me I've left behind  
'Cause I'll be loving you always  
  
(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)  
Always  
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)  
Always  
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)  
Always  
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)  
Did you know you're loved by somebody  
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)  
Always  
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)  
I'll be lovin' you forever  
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)

Until the ocean severs every mountain high)

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles  
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space  
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double  
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed  
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it  
You're not helpin' to make this earth  
A place sometimes called hell  
Change your words into truths  
And then change that truth into love  
And maybe our children's grandchildren  
And their great grandchildren will tell  
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky

Hannah you're with me in spirit wherever I go  
To the ends of the earth and all points between high and low  
Each night by the stage you appear as you are  
The ever intangible child  
Ageless and timeless as Dorian Grey  
Oh Hannah I know that it's you and you're leading me on  
  
Hannah you're my inspiration my fountain of youth  
And as your surrogate leader I'm bound in your searach for the truth  
And yes how the truth rushes out  
When it's become honestly clear  
I see your anxious and curious eyes  
But Hannah I need you as much as you think you need me  
Come to your window tonight and we'll fly to your dreams  
And we'll  
  
Sing for the day sing for the moment  
Sing for the time of your life  
Come for an hour stay for a moment  
Stay for the rest of your life  
  
Hannah don't fail me I need you like never before  
Father time's at my back on my heels  
Behind every door (and he says)  
Son when the youth has but gone from your face  
Will she let you grow older with grace?  
Or will she give you up for one younger than you?  
Oh Hannah please tell me the things that he says are untrue  
Hannah I'm honestly hoping you'll always be there  
  
Sing for the day sing for the moment  
Sing for the time of your life  
Come for an hour stay for a moment  
Stay for the rest of your life

And it's so big and it's gonna burst  
All you people with your heads in the ground  
Hey brother, where you bound?  
  
And they're no good and they're everywhere  
Try to tell you, but you just don't care  
Try to hear you but you don't make a sound  
Hey brother, where you bound?  
Hey brother, where you bound?  
  
And you don't know what they're gonna do  
And you don't know how they feel  
And you don't know what they're tellin' you  
Is it a lie or is it real  
And the next thing that you know is  
That they walk out on the deal  
  
And the message that they're giving you  
Is the same old alibi  
If you don't quite see their point of view  
Then they treat you like a spy  
And the phone rings and you disappear  
In the middle of the night  
  
Can't you see they're on the move  
Don't know what you're trying to prove  
But you sit there oh so cool  
Like they never broke no rules  
  
And the cat flies and the crow walks  
And the ghost dies and the sow talks  
And they tell us that they'll be good as gold  
Be...'lieve nothing that you're told  
Hey brother, where's your soul?  
  
Make a move in one direction  
Try to make some compromise  
But they greet you with rejection  
Makin' out you're tellin' lies  
Then they turn around and tell you  
Better get down from the sky  
  
For the sake of all that's holy  
Listen good to what I say  
I can feel them all around me  
They could be here any day  
But you act like you don't know me  
Why d' you look at me that way  
  
If there's one thing that is clear  
We gotta get away from here  
We've gotta leave this place  
It's just a hopeless case  
Ain't no one else to blame  
We're gonna lose this game  
  
Hey brother get off my back  
I gotta tell you, you're way off the track  
They got a hatred deep down inside  
Ain't gonna let them take me alive  
  
I'm gonna burn them down, just wait and see  
Ain't gonna let them walk over me  
Boy you ain't got no heart and soul  
And your mind is weak and your blood's runnin' cold  
  
You better move, you better hide  
They're gettin' in, they're gettin' inside  
If you get caught you better know  
They're gonna reap, you're gonna sow  
  
Don't be a fool, we gotta go  
Ain't no place safe for us to stay  
We better move on, we better move on

Me, I haven't got a clue  
But floating on a magic carpet high above the earth  
You can see the world like a Buddha, bread and Buddha  
Bigger than you hurt  
Don't you know that love is work  
Cold, no heat on the horizon guess I'm cold  
And Capricorn is rising yes I'm cold  
Listened to my old Nockles  
Hoped that it would warm the cockles  
You can't fight the fear you can't, this is the road you're on  
You don't belong to me you don't belong to any one  
Your reputation lies not in your eyes, but those who dare  
Will bite the hand that feeds when it don't meet your needs  
When you got blood to bleed, you got a life to lead  
In the flood with my blood I can hold you  
Cold, been excommunicated ?cause I'm cold  
My temperature's been rated and I'm cold  
Bring to me my big old sweater  
Nothing more will make me better  
Cold, no heat on the horizon guess I'm cold  
There'll be no compromising, cold, cool, cold  
Stone cold  
Stone cold  
Cold  
Cold  
Cold

Drinking beer so slowly, sometimes wine  
No God, air, water or sunshine  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I took your love and I used it  
Up till now my youthful stage  
A useless rage, a torn out page, a worn out gauge  
A dirty shade, a big charade, a has been made  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I took your love and I used it  
I never, I never, I never  
Up till now my love life  
Few sweet kisses, a little missus, a fork and knife  
A happy home, a hand to hold, a land to roam  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I used to take life in my own hands and I abused it  
Up till now I used to tap dance  
Take a girl by the hand saying  
""I need your, I need your romance""  
Oh I had me many chances  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I used to take your love and I'd abused it  
Up till now the path of life was fair enough  
Enough was fair, all was right  
And now I know, I see the light  
And honesty was my only excuse

And before you get him sussed  
He's gone before dusk  
  
And when you arise  
Red ruby rings circle your eyes  
If it's later than you realized  
Check with the stars and the skies  
  
Old moon madness has struck again  
  
A howl in the dark light  
A flash of teeth bright white  
A scream and a bite  
Old moon madness has struck again tonight  
  
But there's no need to worry  
For the crimes that you've done  
Worse has been committed  
With no moon madness to blame it on  
  
Old moon madness has struck again  
  
In fact you could say you're lucky  
You and me  
Mother Earth has only one moon  
And not three

On my way  
Passing through I heard a voice  
Whisper good evening  
I turned to a shadow  
And saw her there  
So all alone  
She had those sad china eyes  
That sang each time she smiled  
Ah, but the song  
It seemed to linger  
So long it deepened  
My love for her  
Until she called me near  
And then we waltzed to our heart beat  
All around  
The sea was swaying  
The breeze was praying  
Never to leave her alone  
Alone  
Oh, the time just slipped on by  
And with the time  
So did our love  
Ah, her every move  
Just like a fever  
Just like a fever  
Burnin' inside would not leave me

Drew me loving to your isle  
  
And you sang, ""Sail to me, sail to me, let me enfold you""  
Here I am, here I am waiting to hold you  
  
Did I dream you dreamed about me?  
Were you hare when I was fox?  
Now my foolish boat is leaning  
Broken lovelorn on your rocks  
  
For you sing, ""Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow""  
Oh my heart, oh my heart shies from the sorrow  
  
I'm as puzzled as The Oyster (alt. 'as a newborn child')  
I'm as troubled as the tide  
Should I stand amid the breakers?  
Or should I lie with death my bride?  
Hear me sing, ""Swim to me, swim to me, let me enfold you""  
Oh my heart, oh my heart is waiting to hold you

Tom Waits,Pasties And A G-String,/t/tom+waits/pasties+a+g+string_20138938.html,"Smelling like a brewery, looking like a tramp,  
I ain't got a quarter, got a postage stamp  
Been five o'clock shadow boxing all around the town,  
Talking with the old man, sleeping on the ground  
Bazanti bootin al zootin' al hoot and Al Cohn  
Sharing this apartment with a telephone pole  
And a fish-net stocking, spike-heel shoes,  
Strip tease, prick tease, car keys blues  
And the porno floor show, live nude girls,  
Dreamy and creamy and brunette curls  
Chesty Morgan and Watermelon Rose  
Raise my rent and take off all your clothes  
With trench coats, magazines, a bottle full of rum,  
She's so good, make a dead man come  
Pasties and a G-string, beer and a shot  
Portland through a shot glass and a Buffalo squeeze  
Wrinkles and Cherry and Twinkie and Pinkie and Fifi live from Gay Paree  
Fanfares, rim shots, back stage, who cares, all this hot burlesque for me  
(scat)  
Cleavage, cleavage, thighs and hips  
From the nape of her neck to the lipstick lips  
Chopped and channeled and lowered and louvred  
And the cheater slicks and baby moons  
She's a-hot and ready, creamy and sugared  
And the band is awful and so are the tunes  
(scat)  
Crawling on her belly, and shaking like jelly,  
And I'm getting harder than Chinese algebrassieres  
And cheers from the (hmm) compendium here  
""Hey sweetheart"" they're yelling for more  
You're squashing out your cigarette butts on the floor  
And I like Shelly, and you like Jane  
And what was the girl with the snakeskin's name?  
And it's an early-bird matinee, come back any day,  
Get you a little something that you can't get at home  
Get you a little something that you can't get at home  
It's pasties and a G-string, beer and a shot  
Portland through a shot glass and a Buffalo squeeze  
Popcorn, front row, higher than a kite, and I'll be back tomorrow night,  
And I'll be back tomorrow night

Past a watermelon stand on the way  
Thinking I had everything we'd need  
On Martha's foolish ginger  
You were late  
How could I forget what you said-  
The part about that  
""Love taking over your life""  
Was not your plan  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
  
Through the cliffs  
Out of the bay I went  
From the starboard side  
I could black my visions and my passions-  
They keep me awake  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
  
A familiar voice  
""Hi. Surprise.  
I've been searching trying to find you""  
I couldn't speak  
My hands reached for Martha's foolish ginger  
We talked until the moon came up  
About how life without love  
Isn't worth very much  
Then I played this song  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
What I would have done

Twenty One Pilots,Holding On To You,/t/twenty+one+pilots/holding+on+to+you_21052891.html,"I'm taking over my body  
Back in control, no more shotty  
I bet a lot of me was lost  
""T""'s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted  
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot  
Like flesh is all I got  
Not any more, flesh out the door  
  
I must'a forgot, you can't trust me  
I'm moment-to-moment and close but don't show it  
Before you know it I'm lost at sea  
And now that I write and think about it  
And the story unfolds  
You should take my life  
You should take my soul  
  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Sounding down the mountain range  
Of my left-side brain  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Twisting the kaleidoscope  
Behind both of my eyes  
  
And I'll be holding on to you  
  
Remember the moment  
You know exactly where you're goin'  
'Cause the next moment before you know it  
Time is slowin' and it's rolling still  
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?  
You think twice about your life  
It probably happens at night, right?  
  
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it  
Tie a noose around your mind  
Loose enough to breath fine and tie it  
To a tree tell it,  
You belong to me, this ain't a noose  
This is a leash and I have news for you  
You must obey me!  
  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Sounding down the mountain range  
Of my left-side brain  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Twisting the kaleidoscope  
Behind both of my eyes  
  
Entertain my faith  
  
Lean with it, rock with it  
When we gonna stop with it?  
Lyrics that mean nothing  
We were gifted with thought  
  
Is it time to move our feet  
To an introspective beat  
It ain't the speakers that bump hard  
It's our hearts that make the beat  
  
And I'll be holding on to you

Yep, silver and gold... This song was written in a hotel room in New York city
'round about the time a friend or ours, Little Steven, was putting together a
record of artists against apartheid. This is a song written about a man in a
shanty town outside of Johannesburg. A man who's sick of looking down the
barrel of white South Africa. A man who is at the point where he is ready to
take up arms against his oppressor. A man who has lost faith in the
peacemakers of the west while they argue and while they fail to support a man
like bishop Tutu and his request for economic sanctions against South Africa.

Van Der Graaf Generator,Sleepwalkers,/v/van+der+graaf+generator/sleepwalkers_20243047.html,"At night, this mindless army, ranks unbroken by dissent,  
Is moved into action and their pace does not relent.  
In step, with great precision, these dancers of the night  
Advance against the darkness - how implacable their might!  
Eyes undulled by moon, their arms and legs akimbo,  
They walk and live, hoping soon to surface from this limbo.  
Their minds, anticipating the dawn of the day,  
Shall never know what's waiting mere insight away  
Too far, too soon.  
  
Senses dimmed in semi-sentience, only wheeling through this plane,  
Only seeing fragmented images prematurely curtailed by the brain,  
But breathing, living, knowing in some measure at least  
The soul which roots the matter of both Beauty and the Beast.  
From what tooth or claw does murder spring,  
From what flesh and blood does passion?  
Both cut through the air with the pendulum's swing  
In deadly but delicate fashion.  
And every range of feeling is there in the dream  
And every logic's reeling in the force of the scream  
The senses sting.  
And though I may be dreaming and reality stalls  
I only know the meaning of sight and that's all  
And that's nothing.  
  
The columns of the night advance,  
Infectiously, their cryptic dance  
Gathers converts to the fold -  
In time the whole raw world will pace these same steps  
On into the same bitter end.  
  
Somnolent muster now the dancing dead  
Forsake the shelter of their secure beds,  
Awaken to a slumber whose depths they dread,  
As if the ground they tread would give way  
Beneath the solemn weight of their conception.  
I'd search the hidden corners of all this world,  
Make reason of the sensory whorl  
If I only had time,  
But soon the dream is ended.  
  
Tonight, before you lay down to the sweetness of your sleep  
Do you question your surrender to the drop from Lover's Leap  
Or does the anaesthetic darkness take hold on its very own?  
Does your body rise in service with not one dissenting groan?  
These waking dreams of life and death  
In the mirror are twisted and buckled,  
Lashes flicker, a catch of breath,  
Skin whitening at the knuckles.  
The army of sleepwalkers shake their limbs and are loose  
And though I am a talker, I can phrase no excuse  
Not to rise again.  
In the chorus of the night-time I belong  
And I, like you, must dance to that moonlight song  
And in the end I too must pay the cost of this life.  
If all is lost none is known  
And how could we lose what we've never owned?  
Oh, I'd search out every knowledge that I could find,  
Unravel all the mysteries of mind,  
If I only had time,  
If I only had time,  
But soon my time is ended.

As they lie alone

You'll see them recover the garden of life  
Rise up ride the wind after the ring of fire  
The bond of the goddess guards this chosen night  
  
Rise up ride the wind after the ring of fire  
The skies are proclaiming the city is blest  
Rise up ride the wind after the reign of terrord  
With fortune inside us on this dawn of night  
  
We're alive the gods arrive, the cracks of doom roll by  
Steer the course that pallas walks don't let the violence fall  
Under the spell of darkness or light  
We are proven now fortune rides on our side.  
Descend to paradise it's narrow, virgin bright  
Endless night  
  
Guide the rings of the sun, now we are all forms in one!  
  
Victory in the sunlight of union above and below  
  
Sacrosanct lords of the skies, revere the queen of remorse  
Wielding the signs of grace, the signs of faith  
And their darkness aligns with your rays!  
  
Victory, in the sunlight of union we stand!  
  
I'm returning slowly to the ground (it's resurrection day)  
Returning slowly to the ground  
To the ground!

Producers: Brian Rawlings and Mark Taylor  
Album: Twenty Four Seven (99)  
  
Once in a lifetime you find  
Someone to show you the way  
Someone to make your decisions  
But I let you lead me astray  
Who did you think you were fooling  
Said you were missing me blind  
But the truth is I knew you were lying  
You were using me time after time  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
Oh live without you  
Oh I can live without you  
  
Time to move on with my life now  
Leaving the past all behind  
I can make my own decisions  
It was only a matter of time  
Sometimes I look back in anger  
Thinking about all the pain  
But I know that I'm stronger without you  
And that I'll never need you again  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
Oh live without you  
Oh I can live without you  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you  
Won't look over my shoulder

When the heartache is over

I think he sees things I don't understand  
It's the 33rd of August and I'm finally touching down  
Eight days from Sunday finds me Saturday bound  
I stumbled through the darkness tumble to my knees  
A thousand voices screaming in my brain  
Wound up in a squad car busted down for vacancy  
Outside my cell it's sure as hell looks just like rain  
It's the 33rd of August...  
I've put my dangerous feelings under lock and chain  
Killed my violent nature with a smile  
Let the demons danced and sang their songs within my fevered brain

Have you ever felt  
How far a heart can fall  
Have you ever stayed up waiting  
For a telephone call  
Just to hear her say hello  
'Cause you miss each other so  
Have you ever been in love?  
  
Have there been times to laugh  
And times you really want to cry  
Finding reasons to believe her  
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied  
And when in times of doubt  
Have you ever tried to work it out  
But still she leaves you wondering  
What it's all about  
  
And when she's far away  
Have you ever felt the need to stray  
And tried and then discovered  
It just doesn't pay  
'Cause with her, you can be true  
And with her, you can be you  
Have you ever been in love?

But still she leaves you wondering

Can you call your house a home  
Do you dream you're still together  
And wake up alone

Who,Long Live Rock,/w/who/long+live+rock_20146761.html,"Down at the Astoria the scene was changing  
Bingo and rock were pushing out x-rating  
We were the first band to vomit at the bar  
And find the distance to the stage too far  
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'-clock  
Rock is dead they say  
Long live rock  
  
Long live rock! I need it every night  
Long live rock! Come on and join the line  
Long live rock! Be it dead or alive  
  
People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving  
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins  
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong  
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone  
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock  
Rock is dead they say  
Long live rock  
  
Long live rock! I need it every night  
Long live rock! Come on and join the line

Landslide, rocks are falling, falling down upon our very heads  
We tried but you were yawning. Look again  
Rock is dead  
Rock is dead  
Rock is dead  
  
The place is really jumping to the high watt amps  
'Til a twenty inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps  
In the blackout they danced right into the aisle  
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles  
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock  
Rock is dead they say

Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time  
I got a question, if the prodda dressin' and the Gucci  
All got goes, and the freeze on the Lucci  
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough  
  
Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?  
Don't answer quick, think about it cause I'm askin' for real  
Golddiggers goin' to hear this song drivin' and crash at the wheel  
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin' along fine

No music I ever made, ain't nothin' I wanted more  
We could deal with whatever together  
Sunshine, all that other weather, when we chasin' forever

I want to stay, lets stay together  
Chasing forever, with only you

Should we pursue with somethin' real or just chasin' a dream  
Or casin' the scene  
Fore I die I plan  
  
To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands  
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure  
But I'm committed to growin and coming at you mature  
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good  
  
But when we feelin' the hurt, if we willin' to work  
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind  
Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine  
My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust  
  
An taught me monogomy is uh, monogamous

Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right

It's a chase we gotta make together, forever

Hiding behind my ego, evil but no  
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain  
You searchin' for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin'  
  
Finally found a person, worthy of all  
Instead of pushin' me down, you want to cushion my fall  
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing  
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring  
  
More carrats than even bugs could eat in a week  
An the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek  
I'll tell you what I see in the future  
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids callin' you mom and callin' me dad  
  
Havin more good times than JJ had  
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it  
Let no man sever, welcome to forever

Yo, too many songs, weak rhymes that's mad long  
Make it brief Son, half short and twice strong  
No doubt, it took time searchin, eventually  
It was prime urgent, for you to examine the rhyme merchant  
  
Lace MC's with styles when they rhyme drunk  
On a label hunt, until twenty thou, out the trunk  
Eight Diagram sword swinga armored tank force  
RZA throw in the disc but then change the bank source  
  
You can't flow, must be the speech impediment  
You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President  
Whether in Amsterdam smokin seven grams of green  
Then you pack, a thousand white teens in tight jeans  
  
This Witty Unpredictable shot is critical  
To analytical analogy, insurance policies why  
Said he know that sounds define the note  
Couldn't recognize, blast him the fuck behind the ropes  
  
Too many dope niggaz I see starvin  
Catch a single deal, a possible plea bargain  
Wu slay regardles to whom or what, five mics five nights  
Hang him from the balcony, drop twenty-five flights  
  
A fugitive bass playin rap czar  
Smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tical got a hold on ya, doin exactly  
What the fuck I mariju-wanta, dis nigga nasty  
Deep in the dirty dungeon, buggin, lovin  
The ways these rhymes keep comin, at cha splash ya  
  
Get your head piece fractured, with killer cuts  
Prone to drops ya, slash ya, rip shit up  
Got this whole thing Tang mastered, sho nuff  
An MC too good to be touched, John John  
  
Bring the phenomenon, I cold crush  
MC, inferiorities they froze up, ice cold  
As we move on, saga unfold  
Captivated by a saga that go untold, like Goldfinger  
  
Caught up in a cliffhanger  
Yo I-N-S another code red, danger, break out the vest  
Now it's tactical warfare, it's all here  
Come with your shield and hardware, it be on here  
  
Don't ever roam, in the naked city  
Eight Fingers stories none pretty  
Bomb em wit the Witty Unpredictable, conditionin be critical  
Peace to Tang, gettin high on your physical, dis next drink  
  
Is a toast to your memory  
When I go how many niggaz gon' remember me

However, I master the trick just like Nixon

And you watch a corny nigga fold  
Yeah, they fake and all that  
Carryin' gats but yo, my Clan  
Rollin like forty Macs

Wu-Tang banger, 36 styles of danger

I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches  
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits  
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin'

Bust this, I'm kickin' like Segal, Out For Justice  
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus  
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue  
Murder one, my style shot ya knot like a stun-gun  
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness  
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown  
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA  
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga  
So bad, stabbin' up the pad with the vocab, crab  
I scream on ya ass like your dad, bring it on

Yo, I'm more rugged than slave man boots  
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops  
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp!  
A mud hole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp  
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night  
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous  
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe  
Choppin' through ya back swish  
Givin' bystanders heart-attacks  
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him  
I blow up his fuckin' prism  
Make it a vicious act of terrorism  
You want to bring it, so fuck it  
Come on and bring the ruckus  
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets  
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame  
Who sellin' gain, I'm givin' out a deadly game  
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushin'

Aiyo, we came through thumping like elephants  
The new Range is super-charged, I remains intelligent  
Back to the formula, lord, hard grammar  
This is God school, make sure the lobby ain't jammed up  
Excalibur swords, T-Rexes, bibles of rhymes  
We in the lunchroom, weed and veggies for breakfast  
Polo campus, sicker lances, the crisp  
Hundred dollar kick niggas, that be showing you hand steps  
Back to the dormatory, where niggas  
Broke my forearm and index finger, now you write glory  
True holding my flag, it's all engraved in my blade  
So when I wave it, you gon' say Rae mad  
Now it's 28 Days Later, now Wu's up, do something, you can't

To rip something down, the billboard holders is back  
So when you see me, you gon' say he gets down

From darkness to DNA, I move with my brother  
And we resonate, energy that shifts in colors  
Bringing MC's punishment, then I'm done with it  
The meter leave way on the fast break, I run with it  
It was not a hobby, but a childhood passion  
That had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned  
Every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork  
Hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt  
Check the total amount of MC's inflicted  
With torture, from moving with work that's restricted  
We criticize producers til they joints are right  
Then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light  
Hitting them from well conceiled firing positions  
With explosiveness that'll make the deaf listen  
Drastic, pyroclastic, connected with the same old  
Down the dangerous slopes of an active volcano

Blitz like the Green Bay Packers, sack like the linebackers  
Hang with niggas, like redneck crackers  
Strangle cold bottles of Beck's, like a vexed German

Neck burning, from eight karats of sunlight  
Absorbed, in the grill, Big Pun like  
Lord of the Wu-Tang sword, know what that means?  
Like J.R. Tolkien, it's the Lord of the Rings  
This is my man, Chef, auto, like Grand Theft Auto  
The 18th letter, followed by the mark of Zorro  
Plus A, not for apple, but I pack an apple  
Shorty try to buck back, and knock me off the saddle  
Caramel, pecan, sundae, Pregline  
Plump breasts, was filled with saline  
Her big booty cousin, nasty Nadine  
Get you on the floor, whore tried to double team

Is he really strapped? Will he really split yo' shit?  
I thought you said he rap? Pull up in the yard, ten sets  
He ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding  
Who testing? Rope-a-dope his black lotus  
Can't quote this, chat with the sword tongue  
Duck when the axe is swinging, wild Apache drum  
Crazy Horse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit  
Can't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room  
Space was demanded, beat banging through the speaker  
Voice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener  
Swing to the gospel, catch up and wet at the brothel  
Unstoppable, direction of my flow, optional  
To the ear, depending on the current of air, the crowd's in

I want to see if you can get down  
Get down like you say you do  
In the midnight when I want to feel right  
All I think about is you  
  
Put me in a fly position  
Make me want to scream your name  
And just when you think I've had enough  
I'm like baby do you think we can do it again?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
'Cause everytime you show me that  
And every which way that you throw my back  
I just can't get enough  
I find myself sayin ""let's do it again, let's do it again""  
  
Tingle tingle my body  
You make me oohh baby  
I ain't been the same since then  
That night when you put me in a fly position  
  
You made me scream your name  
You can say I'm sprung out, I don't give a damn  
I want to do it again and again and again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
When we made love for the first time  
It felt so good inside  
I laid across my bed and watched tears run from my eyes  
Too good to let it go  
So don't disturb this flow  
All I know is I can't wait  
Can't wait to do it again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(In the morning) 'cause everytime you show me that  
(Sweet love in the summertime) and every which way that you throw my back  
(Just your sweet face) I just can't get enough  
  
(all laid up next to mine) I find myself sayin ""Let's do it again, let's do it
again""  
'Cause everytime you show me that (Let's do it again)  
And every which way that you throw my back (again, again)  
I just can't get enough

Let's do it, do it, do it, do it, do it again

XTC,Books Are Burning,/x/xtc/books+are+burning_20147770.html,"Books are burning  
In the main square, and I saw there  
The first eating the text  
Books are burning  
In the still air  
And you know where they burn books  
People are next  
I believe the printed word should be forgiven  
Doesn't matter what it said  
Wisdom hotline from the dead back to the living  
Key to the larder for your heart and head  
Books are burning  
In our own town, watch us turn 'round  
And cast our glances elsewhere  
Books are burning  
In the playground  
Smell of burnt book is not unlike human hair  
I believe the printed word is more than sacred  
Beyond the gauge of good or bad  
The human right to let your soul fly free and naked  
Above the violence of the fearful and sad  
The church of matches  
Anoints in ignorance with gasoline  
The church of matches  
Grows fat by breathing in the smoke of dreams  
It's quite obscene  
Books are burning  
More each day now, and I pray now  
You boys will tire of these games  
Books are burning  
I hope somehow, this will allow  
A phoenix up from the flames

Stood a man with glasses held high,  
Wondering when to do it again  
Have another fly into the sky,  
Somewhere flying high.

Wandering where lights go,  
Leave out the body load.  
  
Once in the air, people who dare  
Get a great respect in being.

My fortification took me by surprise

Singing the Rule Britannia

There's method in the key of see

Just simply jiving it

Jewel skies crazy spacing it  
Hot sun - Crowded - Screams high voices  
Singing speechless  
  
Touching of the healing heart

As long as music plays its part  
Good good part

Lights out lights out Pass the herb  
Lights out lights out kiss the curb  
Lights out lights out your heart has turned  
Who's going to save me every time I crash and Burn  
And I crash and burn  
  
I'm sick of endings  
I'm done pretending  
I just want you back to normal  
I think you don't know just how you feel  
And every time you think of me  
Remember how things used to be not long ago  
  
Whoa  
  
I'll fated,I skated,  
To the party faded,and I saw you there  
I waited, hated, getting ignored  
You stated you didn't care  
Flashes of car crashed and  
Your ashes burning the cement  
The curtain fails, last call, credits roll  
We have reached the end  
  
Lights out lights out Pass the herb  
Lights out lights out kiss the curb  
Lights out lights out your heart has turned  
Who's going to save you every time you crash and Burn  
Crash and burn  
  
I'm sick of endings  
I'm done pretending  
I just want you back to normal  
I think you don't know just how you feel  
And every time you think of me  
Remember how things used to be not long ago  
  
Sick of endings  
I'm done pretending  
Tired of fighting  
I'm sick of always trying  
  
I'm feeling lost,  
I'm feeling like my heart's  
Been carved out with a spoon  
Put on display for all to witness this decay of me and you  
I just want you back to normal  
I think you don't know just how you feel  
And every time you think of me  
Remember how things used to be not long ago  
  
Whoa  
  
Lights out lights out Pass the herb  
Lights out lights out kiss the curb  
Lights out lights out your heart has turned  
Who's going to save me every time I crash and Burn  
I crash and burn  
I crash and burn

Zwan,Heartsong,/z/zwan/heartsong_20148991.html,"come in  
make yourself at home  
i'm a bit late  
hate to make you wait  
  
but heart songs  
are still on my mind  
there's never the time  
to write down these lines  
  
how can you say  
that i don't need you  
just be sure  
no more, no less  
let love confess to you  
what you must do  
  
come on  
let's hit the road  
i'm up to my tricks  
i know they seem cold  
  
but heart songs  
are all that i am  
i use the same words  
to say the same things  
  
how can you say  
that i don't need you  
just be sure  
no more, no less  
let love confess to you  
what you must do  
  
how can you say  
that i don't need you  
just be sure  
no more, no less  
let love confess to you  
no less
