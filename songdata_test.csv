Make all my dreams come true

You please me, you excite me

I feel a kind of fear  
When I don't have you near  
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride

Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
I've had a few little love affairs  
They didn't last very long and  
They've been pretty scarce  
I used to think that was sensible  
It makes the truth  
Even more incomprehensible  
'Cause everything is new  
And everything is you

And wonder where they fly

Just when it seemed that miracles  
Where not too much to ask  
  
And though the world may turn too fast  
If it should seem like paradise

His spirit all divine fills a sinful soul of mine

Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul  
How he brought salvation and he made me whole

And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal  
I go to God in prayer, I can always find him there  
To whisper sweet peace to my soul  
  
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul  
How he brought salvation and he made me whole  
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart  
Well he made me laugh and he made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire

He walked up every step of Calvary's rugged way  
And gave his life completely to bring a better day  
My life was steeped in sin but in love he took me in  
His blood washed away every stain

Arlo Guthrie,Gates Of Eden,/a/arlo+guthrie/gates+of+eden_20209380.html,"Of war and peace the truth just twists, its curfew gull it glides  
Upon four legged forest clouds the cowboy angel rides  
With his candle lit into the sun though it's glow is waxed in black  
All except beneath the trees of Eden  
The lamp post stands with folded arms its iron claws attached  
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail  
Through its shadow's metal badge  
All in all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow  
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden  
The savage soldier sticks his head in the sand and then complains  
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf but still remains  
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails  
Heading for the Gates of Eden  
The time rusted compass blade, Aladdin and his lamp  
Sits with Utopian hermit monks, side saddle on the Golden Calf  
And on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh  
All except inside the Gates of Eden  
Relationships of ownership they whisper in the wings  
To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings  
And I try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings  
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden  
The motorcycle 'Black Madonna', two-wheeled gypsy queen  
And her silver-studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream  
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey, pick up on his bread crumb sins  
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden  
The kingdoms of experience in the precious winds they rot  
While paupers change possessions  
Each one wishing for what the other has got  
And the princess and the prince discuss what's real and what's not  
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden  
The foreign sun it squints upon a bed that is never mine  
As friends and others, strangers from their fates try to resign  
Leaving men holy and totally free to do anything they wish to do but die  
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden  
At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams  
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse  
Into the ditch of what each one means  
At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true  
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

I might get up the nerve  
But if my timing ain't just right  
What purpose would it serve?  
I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know how to say those first few words  
If I want to put myself in touch  
The first few moments mean so much  
  
So I suppose it's now or never  
Before that woman walks right out of my life  
Just let me pull myself together  
I've got to give it one good try  
Gotta take my chance tonight  
I've gotta get it right the first time  
That's the main thing  
I can't afford to let it pass  
You get it right the next time it's not the same thing  
Gonna have to make the first time last

I'd jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin,  
I'd even dance a jig on the ground.  
Well, everybody gets their hour,  
Everybody gets their time,  
Little David when he picked up his pebbles,  
Even Sampson after he went blind.  
Well, everybody gets the chance  
To do what they want to do.

When you hear me yellin', ""Fee-fi-fo-fum.""  
Well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle,  
You made me to a walkin' wreck,  
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone,  
Then you knocked off my head from my neck.  
Well, if I'm ever standin' steady  
A-doin' what I want to do,  
Well, I tell you little lover that you better run for cover

After all my liquor's been drunk,  
After my dreams are dreamed out,  
After all my thoughts have been thunk,  
Well, after I do some of these things,  
I'm gonna do what I have to do.

Those bukowski poems we couldn't live without  
Your high school pic when you had wild hair  
That stormy day on the beach that got us here  
  
Oh, you better believe theres just one thing you need  
Can't you see...  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams  
Its just me baby  
  
Just like a shadow 10 feet tall  
Standing right behind you should you fall  
Ill be the one to hold you up to walk  
When this wicked world makes us want to crawl  
  
Abd if your waves should ever break at sea  
Ill be there waiting, I'm that sandy beach  
I'm that same old dog, scratching those same fleas  
Ill be by your side, you can count on me  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
Whats it gonna take to make you see  
Whats it gonna take til you believe in me  
  
Oh, how my smile fades and my heart just breaks  
Every time you go away  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
Whats it gonna take to make you see  
Whats it gonna take til you believe in me  
  
And if someday some new memory comes along  
Looking shiny new, feeling really strong  
You can tell him that Ill tell him  
He can just move on  
I'm a fighter - I've been fighting for you all night long  
Its just me baby

For two dollars down I signed my name on the lease  
There was a knock on my door, old man wants his keys  
All he said was something about bankruptcy  
  
Oh no, here we go  
There ain't no day that's different from the day you know that  
Life's too short for days like these  
Try to close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees  
Life's too short for days like these  
  
Minding my own business in a restaurant  
Trying to get some dinner but then guess what?  
Some chick got there I slept with, threw her drink in my face  
And then her ugly brother kicked my ass all over the place  
  
Oh no, here we go  
Ain't no day that's different from the day you know that  
Life's too short for days like these  
Try to close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees  
Life's too short for days like these  
Too short baby  
  
I met her last night at quarter to three  
I couldn't believe that she came home with me  
Woke up this morning scratching now I know when to leave  
They say you lay down with dogs, you wake up with fleas  
  
You know that life's too short for days like these  
Try to close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees

I'd get up and dance if I could get on my feet

Happy to see that the dawn was slowly breaking

You still have that kind of impact  
  
Everywhere I turn I see your face  
Proving that a fool's love never fades  
In my mind your image is forever burned  
I keep trying not to stare but your always there  
Everywhere I turn  
  
In a steamed up cafe window  
I spell out your name  
I watch people run across the street  
Through the pouring rain  
There you are again so easy to find  
Under the umbrella in another woman's eyes

And my mind would let go of the pain, any day

Carly Simon,Into White,/c/carly+simon/into+white_20717568.html,"I built my house from barley rice  
Green pepper walls and water ice  
Tables of paper wood  
Windows of light  
And everything emptying into white  
  
A simple garden, with acres of sky  
A brown-haired dogmouse  
If one should drop by  
Yellow delanie would sleep well at night  
And everything emptying into white  
And everything emptying into white  
  
A blue eyed drummer rehearses outside  
A black spider dancing on top of his eye  
Red legged chicken stands ready to strike  
And everything emptying into white

Something I could never deny  
For the first the first  
After all this time  
I found true love  
  
I have never been so happy in my life  
Till you finally showed me for the first time  
I know this time I found true love  
  
CHROUS  
And I believe from the moment we met  
Your love is truly as good as it is  
That, once I let you go  
I'll never be happy again  
  
And I believe for the very first time  
Your love is truly  
Meant to be mine  
And my heart knows once I let you go  
I'll never be happy again  
  
You gave me the reason to live, now  
All I ever want is to give you all of me  
Cause I believe you gave me true love

Blackbird has spoken like the first bird.  
Praise for the singing,  
Praise for the morning,  
Praise for them springing fresh from the world.  
  
Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven,  
Like the first dewfall on the first grass.  
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden,  
Sprung in completeness where his feet pass.  
  
Mine is the sunlight,  
Mine is the morning,  
Born of the one light Eden saw play.  
Praise with elation, praise ev'ry morning,  
God's recreation of the new day.

Yeah I want to drive your, your long and beautiful  
Your rounded-body, wheel-to-roll limousine  
I've never had the thrill of riding such a wonderful machine  
  
We'll roll 'round the mountain, drive down in the valley  
I would drive it all over, I would ride you home with ease  
You will enjoy every journey, it will be my aim to please  
  
So let me be your driver, let me be your driver  
I would love to ride you, I would love to ride you downtown  
Drive you so slow and easy you won't want to put me down

And the sun shines brightly on the mountaintop,  
I took a trip on a sailing ship,  
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop.  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,  
Won't be back for many a day,  
My heart is down, my head is turning around,  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town.  
  
Down at the market you can hear,  
All the ladies cry out while on their heads they bear,  
Akie rice, salt fish are nice,  
And the sun is fine any time of the year.  
  
[CHORUS  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,  
Won't be back for many a day,  
My heart is down, my head is turning around,  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town.]  
  
Sounds of laughter everywhere,  
And the children sway to and fro,  
I must declare that my heart is there,  
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico.  
  
[CHORUS (twice)  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,  
Won't be back for many a day,

Now someone else is holdin' her just like I used to do  
I can see it all so clearly now from a stranger's point of view.  
  
This stranger's eyes can't take the pain of seeing her like this  
This stranger's eyes can't overlook everything I missed  
I never thought I'd see the day I'd miss her like I do  
Until the day I looked at her from a stranger's point of view...

We were kids still growing up with rainbows in our mind  
So off we went into the world not knowing what we'd find  
The first few days were filled with fun and laughing her and I  
We'd stop from place to place to try the good times on for size  
She always wore a yellow rose to show her love for me  
A yellow rose so everyone could see  
Have you seen the girl with yellow roses in her hair  
She's as pretty as could be  
She always wears a yellow rose so everyone can see  
She always wears a yellow rose for me  
Now the days have past so quickly and the living got so rough  
Suddenly we found we couldn't live just on our love  
Just two kids alone with thought of Kansas in our mind  
Thinking of the families loving arms we left behind  
Of each new day I found that we grew more and more apart  
Though she tried to cling to me with love still in her heart  
Then one day I hurt her like a fool I made her cry  
I noticed that the yellow rose had died  
Have you seen the girl with yellow roses in her hair  
Help me find her won't you please

She was deaming of al jolson  
And what she thought he said  
  
He was looking in the mirror  
He was putting on the paint  
Said the hardest thing about this job  
Is being what you ain't

In a strange new world  
Can you come out tonight

Love is lost, and lost is love  
  
Your country's new, your friends are new  
Your house, and even your eyes are new  
Your maid is new, and your accent, too  
But your fear is as old as the world  
  
Say goodbye to the thrills of life  
When love was good, when love was bad  
Wave goodbye to the life without pain  
Say hello, your beautiful girl  
  
Say hello to the greater men  
Tell them your secrets they're like the grave  
Oh what have you done, oh what have you done  
Love is lost, lost is love  
  
You know so much, it's making you cry  
You refuse to talk, but you think like mad  
You've cut out your zone and the things have fold  
  
Oh what have you done, oh what have you done  
Oh what have you done, oh what have you done

Through the valley of night  
One chance to be heard  
And it's well worth the fight  
  
Uh you better keep your body moving  
Don't wait for a feeling  
To finally grow  
Into an answer you've been hearing  
Because you already know  
  
But they can't take it away, they can't take it away  
But they can't take it away, they can't take it away  
  
Come on with me  
  
One voice and it's got to be you  
We can only get one heart  
And it's got to be through  
  
So if your love is breakthrough, turns voice  
You cannot live without a voice  
You cannot live without a voice

strong  
  
True love we knew in the past is gone but our weakness lingers on  
  
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong  
  
Long ago we let the flame of love burn out of control  
  
Now we have no reason to reach for love that has grown cold  
  
If we live our past in the present our future will be gone  
  
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong  
  
[ fiddle ]  
  
Line with temptation we raced into the past  
  
On a road too small to let the past and the present pass  
  
Are we going too fast to turn back and leave the past alone  
  
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong  
  
Long ago we let the flame...  
  
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong

Nothing left to do but try

And hold on to it like a vice  
Have to face the falling chips  
I just might make it, I just might  
  
Oh, I might have been a fool  
But its true that love is blind  
And you have broken every rule  
You've taken all that yours and mine  
And how does one go on with life?  
When your shattered so inside  
Pieces of a love gone wrong  
Well, ya pick 'em up and you move along

Well, I might even be surprised

After you've gone, there's no denying  
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad  
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had  
  
There'll come a time, now don't forget it  
There'll come a time, when you'll regret it  
Some day when you'll grow lonely  
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only  
After you've gone, after you've gone away  
  
After I'm gone, after we break up  
After I'm gone, you're gonna wake up  
You will find you were blind  
To let somebody come and change your mind  
  
After the years we've been together  
Thought joy and tears, all kinds of weather  
Someday blue and downhearted  
You'll long to be with me right back where you started  
After I'm gone, after I'm gone away  
  
You will find you were blind

Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face?  
Can't you see  
I'm longing to be in his place?  
Won't you change partners and dance with me?  
  
Ask him to sit this one out.  
While you're alone,  
I'll tell the waiter to tell  
Him he's wanted on the telephone.  
  
You've been locked in his arms ever since heaven-knows-when.  
Won't you change partners and then,  
You may never want to change partners again.

Ella Fitzgerald,Early Autumn,/e/ella+fitzgerald/early+autumn_20045719.html,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze  
And touches with her hand the summer trees,  
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.  
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,  
  
A winding country lane all russet brown,  
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.  
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,  
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.  
  
I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view  
So early, early.  
Darling if you care, please, let me know,  
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.  
Let's never have to share another early autumn.

Ella Fitzgerald,Ev'rything I've Got,/e/ella+fitzgerald/evrything+ive+got_20045723.html,"Don't stamp your foot at me,  
It's impolite  
To stamp your foot at me  
Is not quite right.  
At man's ingratitude  
A woman winks,  
But such an attitude just stinks.  
  
I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks.  
I have words that do not come from children's books  
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist,  
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist.  
There are hammerlock holds,  
I've mastered a few,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
Share for share, share alike,  
You get struck each time I strike.  
You for me- me for me-  
I'll give you plenty of nothing.  
I'm not yours for better but for worse,  
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse.  
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two,  
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you.  
  
Don't raise your voice at me,  
That's very rude.  
To raise your voice at me  
Is rather crude.  
It's wrong essentially when woman yells,  
And confidentially, it smells.  
  
I'll converse with you on politics at length,  
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength.  
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put,  
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot.  
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
Off to bed we will creep,  
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep  
Till the birds start to peep.  
I'll give you plenty of nothing.  
I'll be yours forever and a day  
If the first good breeze does not blow me away.  
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
  
You may have some things that I can't use at all.  
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small.  
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
You won't know how good I am until you try  
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry.  
I've a marvelous way of telling you no,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
And everything you want belongs to me!  
And everything you need belongs to me!  
  
Life has no shape or form  
And no design.  
It isn't life without  
That fool of mine.  
I used to gad about  
With any chap  
And now I'm sad about my sap.  
  
He's a living thing that isn't quite alive,  
He has brains enough for any child of five.  
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim,  
But everything I've got belongs to him.  
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone.  
He has eyes for every skirt except my own.  
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb,  
But everything I've got belongs to him.  
Something beats in his chest,  
But it's just a pump at best.  
I'm for him, he's for him.  
He gives me plenty of nothing.  
When I see that funny face, I know  
Something scared his mother twenty years ago.  
But I'll never let go, he'll never be free!  
Till everything he's got belongs to me!  
  
And everything I've got belongs to him!  
And everything I've got belongs to us!

But no local yokel's gonna shut me down  
Cause me and the boys got this rig unwound  
And we've come a thousand miles from the guitar town  
  
Nothin' ever happened round my home town  
And I ain't the kind to just hang around  
But I heard someone callin' my name one day  
And I followed that voice down the lost highway  
Everybody told me you can't get far  
Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down  
And a rockin' little combo from the guitar town  
  
Hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault  
Love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt  
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop  
Stumble in the restaurant, wonderin' why I don't stop  
Well I gotta keep rockin' while I still can  
Got a two-pack habit and a motel tan  
When my boots hit the boards it's a brand new hand  
Put my back to the risers and make my stand  
Hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight  
I'm loadin' up and rollin' out of here tonight  
One of these days I'm gonna settle down

I wish I were a swallow flying  
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place  
I'd join the wild birds in their crying

But now the stars have turned against me  
And he cares no more for me

Seem to want to glorify these days  
  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
She looks like she used to be happy with  
The girl inside  
  
She looks so bored sometimes  
She has that super pale skin  
And those soft green eyes  
She looks like she  
Could have been happy  
In a better life  
  
She came out west  
Just to break away clean  
From her family and her friends  
And a little girl's dream  
All she wants to do every night  
Is to sit beside my window  
And listen to the sirens  
  
She is perfect in that fucked up way  
That all the magazines  
Seem to want to glorify these days  
  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
She looks like she should have been happy  
In another life  
  
In another life  
  
She came out west  
Just to break the spell  
After three long years'  
In a marriage from hell  
Six months clean  
Living sober and right  
The doctors tell her  
Everything will be alright  
  
Yeah you just take your pill  
And everything will be alright  
  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
She looks like a magazine girl  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
Like she used to be happy  
In another world  
  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
She is happy with the girl inside  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
And looks like she could have been  
Happy in another life  
  
In another life  
Happy in another life  
  
Met her at a party  
And I took her home  
She is the saddest girl  
That I have ever known  
She wakes me up  
In the middle of the night  
Just to tell me  
Everything will be alright  
Amy smiles at me and tells me  
Everything will be alright  
  
I tell myself the same damn thing  
  
Everyday  
  
Everything will be alright

So wipe off the frown

Fading in the distance  
Recollections drifting  
Bloodstains on my tattered clothes  
Each minute the fear grows  
If I could just lay down to rest  
I'm tired of searching for myself  
If I am dead, how can I feel such love?  
If I am dead, why am I dreaming?  
If I am dead, where do I go from here?  
If I am dead, why does this pain feel so good?  
Is this blood dried upon my face?  
Or is it the love of someone else?  
It tastes so sweet, just like you used to  
So rescue me my love, splice us together  
I remember loving you so much  
But where are you and where's your fatal touch?  
When I closed my eyes, was it my siesta?  
Did I encounter a darkness stronger than sleep?  
I am thirsty for my sleep

These things that I hold  
The skin of my emotions  
Lies beneath my own  
You'll never feel  
The heat of this soul  
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown  
To you  
  
You'll say don't fear your dreams  
It's easier than it seems  
You'll say you'd never let me fall  
From hopes so high  
But never is a promise  
And you can't afford to lie  
  
You'll never live the life that I live

You'll never hear the message I give  
You'll say it looks as though I might  
Give up this fight

I see in different lights  
The shades and shadows  
Undulate in my perception  
My feelings swell and stretch  
I see from greater heights  
I realize what I am now too smart to mention  
To you  
  
You'll say you understand,  
You'll never understand  
I'll say I'll never wake up  
Knowing how or why  
I don't know what to believe in  
You don't know who I am  
You'll say I need appeasing  
When I start to cry  
But never is a promise  
And I'll never need a lie

Seekin' my fame and fortune, lookin' for a pot of gold

Know the tune  
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  
  
Rode in on the Greyhound, I'll be walkin' out if I go  
I was just passin' through, must be seven months or more  
Ran out of time and money, looks like they took my  
Friends  
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again  
  
The man from the magazine said I was on my way  
Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play  
I came into town, a one night stand, looks like my plans  
Fell through  
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  
  
If I only had a dollar, for every song I've sung  
And every time I've had to play while people sat there  
Drunk  
You know, I'd catch the next train back to where I live  
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

But you weren't listening.  
Making miracles?  
So, I begged...  
But you were far away.  
Saving souls perhaps?  
So, I screamed...  
But she was very small  
And you have worlds to mend.  
So, she died...  
And you were glorious.  
But you were somewhere else.  
If you are my shepherd  
Then I'm lost and no one can find me.  
If you are my saviour  
Then I'm dead and no one can help me.  
If you are my glory  
Then I'm sick and no one can cure me.  
If you light my darkness  
Then I'm blind and no one can see me.  
If you are my father  
Then love lies abandoned and bleeding.  
If you are my comfort  
Then nightmares are real and deceiving.  
If you are my answer  
Then I must have asked the wrong question.  
I'd spit on your heaven  
If I could find one to believe in.

And wanders out into the street

Broken needles and blood

isn't it a pity how we hurt  
The ones that we love the most of all  
The ones we shouldnt hurt at all

cause life is one long enigma, my friend  
Live on, live on, the answers at the end  
  
Don't be so hard on the ones that you love

It's been a year since you've been gone  
But it seems like yesterday ,you said goodbye  
I'm finding ways to pass the time ,so I won't lose my mind  
  
But my every waking hour I think of you  
That's just a day in the life of a fool  
The one who's holding out for only you  
Knowing all along your love for me is true  
  
It's just a day in the life of a fool  
You would think I'd learn by now , to forget it all some how .  
But my favorite memories were made with you  
So every moment that I have , I live them in the past  
  
Even though there?s no way back to where we were  
That's just a day in the life of a fool  
The one who's holding out for only you  
Knowing all along your love for me is true  
  
It's just a day in the life of a fool  
It's just a day in the life of a fool

As it came tumblin' down  
And the great Niagra Falls  
Well I've seen them too

And the roses start to bud  
Saw the risin' of the moon  
Through a cloud red as blood  
Saw a rainbow of all colors  
When the storm and rain was through.

Done everthing there is to do

Shall I kiss the mouth, stroke the hair  
Undress her - do I dare  
Or bite into the vein above her heaving breast  
Ah, the sun best come up soon  
There's no telling with the moon over madness  
And when I see her face  
The tuft of hair beneath the lace  
I feel the fire of mortal men  
As she draws a languorous breath  
So full of life, so close to death  
I'm filled with wild revenge  
Shall I tear into her skin  
Let the beast inside me win

Or shall I fight my heart no more  
Ease my lover to the floor  
And loose my burden  
What I'd give to know just what I am  
A monster or a man  
An angel born of Hell, or simply human flesh  
One of which is in this room  
Wondering 'neath the mood over madness  
Shall I tear into her skin  
Let the beast inside me win  
I'm so uncertain  
Or shall I end this lonely war  
Ease my lover to the floor  
And loose my burden  
Woman won't you hold me in your arms  
Before you come to harm  
And take this tender love and drive it through my chest  
Stike hard, do it soon

Gloria Gaynor,Last Night,/g/gloria+gaynor/last+night_20631399.html,"I've been spending too much time  
Living in your world instead of mine  
Telling myself that's where I'd rather be  
Pouring the coffee and pouring the wine  
Waiting for you to have forever in mind  
So much more than childish fantasies  
  
It's the last night  
It's our last kiss  
For tomorrow I'll be gone  
It takes more than love to keep me in your arms  
It's the last night  
Come the sunrise  
You can catch me moving on  
It takes more than love to make a woman feel like she belongs  
  
See I've got dreams, I've been dreaming too  
Maybe this time I will see them through  
With a man who wants a love for keeps  
I put on my lipstick and pack me a bag  
Check my look in the mirror and call me a cab  
Gonna drive 'til your pull is out of reach  
  
Oh, it's the last night  
It's our last kiss  
For tomorrow I'll be gone  
It takes more than love to keep me in your arms  
It's the last night  
Come the sunrise  
You can catch me moving on  
It takes more than love to make a woman feel like she belongs  
  
I wish you the very best, you know I really do  
You'll find someone who has temporary dreams like you  
Baby, mine, mine go on forever  
I can feel the future and the wind inside my hair  
Something's trying to tell me there's a whole new world out there  
Baby, I'm sure it just gets better  
  
Oh, it's the last night  
It's our last kiss  
For tomorrow I'll be gone  
It takes more than love to keep me in your arms  
It's the last night  
Come the sunrise  
You can catch me moving on  
It takes more than love to make a woman feel like she belongs

In my time and in each line I've ever sung  
And in my life  
Was it my imagination or are you still the one  
Who lingers on  
I'd do anything for you  
You'd do anything for me  
We'd do anything for love  
Ohh, you'd use any means  
And I would try any scheme for love  
We'd do anything for love  
Once or twice  
In my loneliness I watched the world go by  
There was I  
One too many miles beyond where you might say  
Some luck was due, after all  
We could have touched the sky  
You had no alibi because  
We'd do anything for love  
Ohh, I would try any means  
To have you in all my dreams because  
You'd do anything for love  
Not long ago as I remember  
Once upon a dark and windy day  
When love looked like a dying ember  
Before you came to call  
The beauty of it all, I though I'd lost and yet  
'Cause in my life  
There in my mind in it now shines  
A guiding light  
Never again will I lose my way  
Ohh, I would not tell a lie and  
You had no alibi because  
We'd do anything for love  
Ohh, you'd use any means  
And I would try any scheme for love  
Simply anything for love  
Ohh, I would do anything  
Just about anything because  
We'd do anything for love  
Anything for love  
Anything for love  
Anything for love

With a dollar in my hand  
And an achin' in my heart  
And my pockets full of sand  
  
I'm a long way from home  
And I miss my loved one so  
In the early mornin' rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big 707 set to roll  
But I'm stuck here on the ground  
Where the pavement never grows  
  
The liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
Well there she goes, my friend  
She's movin' out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wings on high  
She's away and westward bound  
High above the clouds she'll fly  
  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall  
And the sun always shines.  
She'll be flyin' o'er my home  
In about three hours time.  
  
This old airport's got me down  
Ain't no earthly good to me  
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
  
You can't hop a jet plane  
The way you can a freight train  
So I'll just be on my way

And time is a-runnin' backwards and so is the bride  
Ring them bells St. Peter where the four winds blow  
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know  
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel of the plow  
And the sun is a-goin' down upon the sacred cow  
Ring them bells sweet Martha for the poor man's son  
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one  
For the shepherd is asleep where the willow weep  
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep  
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf  
Ring them bells all of us who are left  
Ring them bells for the chosen few  
Who will judge the many when the game is through?  
Ring them bells for the time that flies  
For the child who cries when innocence dies  
Ring them bells St. Catherine from the top of the roof  
Ring the bells from the fortress for the lilies that bloom  
For the lines are long and the fighting is strong

Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line.

Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me.  
It was later than I thought when I first believed you,  
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.  
  
Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rockin' of the boat,  
And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float.  
I won't leave you drifting down, but woh it makes me wild,  
With thirty years upon my head to have you call me child.

Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools.

You'll see such an amazing sight.  
All of the wolves gather 'round.  
They make a very sad and lonely sound.  
  
Sadder than the wind through the trees,  
It puts a lot of little goose bumps on me.  
When the wolves sing their song,  
They want you to sing along and...  
  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
  
They come from miles and miles away...  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
They sing all night till the moon sinks low,...  
  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.

Hank Snow,Frosty The Snowman,/h/hank+snow/frosty+the+snow+man_20200802.html,"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal  
Frosty the snowman was a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow but the children know how he come to life one day  
There must have been some magic in that old silk that they found  
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around  
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun now before I melt away  
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can  
He led them down the streets of town right up to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop  
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry I'll be back again some day

You loved me only me

Tell her that I've met my savior  
God has saved her wand'ring boy.  
  
The tears and sorrow I have caused her  
How I wish I could re-pay  
But tell her I'll be waiting for her  
We'll meet in heaven some glad day.  
  
How she cried when I left her  
I know it filled her heart with pain  
She said, son, please don't leave me  
For we may never meet again.

But I know she waits and prays  
Soon I'll cross that dark river  
Please let her know that I was saved.

My cold, cold heart won't let me sleep  
Your lonesome voice that seems to say

My tears pour down like falling rain  
Through restless sleep I call your name  
Perhaps someday beyond the blue  
We'll meet sweetheart and live anew  
Where cold, cold hearts can't enter in  
We'll laugh and love, sweetheart, again

Hank Williams Jr.,Everything Comes Down To Money And Love,/h/hank+williams+jr/everything+comes+down+to+money+and+love_20336326.html,"Sitting at the kitchen table Monday afternoon  
House is so quiet  
I spent the morning looking for a job  
But the job markets pretty tight  
  
And I'm wondering  
Just what I'm gonna do  
Someone to hold and the rent  
I owe are long overdue  
  
Seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life  
It seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life  
  
I'm used to having a woman around  
Cooking for me and when I lay down to love  
I got used to having a woman around  
Looking to me to rise above  
  
I've got a lonely heart, two open arms  
And a pillow I never use  
I know it ain't much to offer  
But it's the best I can do  
  
Seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life  
  
I've loved a lot of good women  
And I could sure love one now  
I've had more than enough money  
In my bank account  
  
But where they went and how they got spent  
Isn't really clear  
They just left me here  
And it all disappeared  
  
Sitting in another office Tuesday morning  
Application filled  
I doubt they'll ever call me  
But I can't keep from hoping that they will  
  
I know I need to keep my chin up  
But I'm telling you the truth  
If there's no one else to live for  
Is there anything left to lose?  
  
It seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life  
Seems like everything comes down  
To money and love in my life, in my life

You know I'll catch you through it all  
  
And you can't keep us apart  
(Even a thousand miles can't keep us apart)  
'Cause my heart is wherever you are  
  
It's like catching lightening, the chances of finding  
Someone like you  
It's one in a million, the chances of feeling  
The way we do  
  
And with every step together  
We just keep on getting better

Oh, no mountain's too high and no ocean's too wide  
'Cause together or not, our dance won't stop  
Let it rain, let it pour, what we have is worth fighting for

Ian Hunter,Irene Wilde,/i/ian+hunter/irene+wilde_20066512.html,"When I was just sixteen - I stood waiting for a dream -  
At barker street bus station every night  
When I tried to get it on - she just looked at me with scorn - my courage  
Turned to dust and I took flight  
  
For those looks they seemed to say  
You ain't nuthin' - go away  
You're just a face in the crowd so I went home and I vowed  
I'm gonna be somebody - someday  
  
Her name was irene wilde - oh such beauty for a child  
When she started dating boys - I nearly died  
For I could not barely stand to see someone hold her hand  
I felt I had to crawl away and hide  
In my mother's living room I composed so many tunes  
All the same - just a frame - for her name, and just to say  
Gonna be somebody - someday  
  
Wild as your name I soon left that country town  
I been around, seen some fame, seen some ups and seen some downs  
Smile through your shock when you hear your name aloud  
It's that face in the crowd - didn't dig it - much too proud...  
  
When I was just sixteen I stood waiting for a dream  
A barker street bus station non affair  
At the time it seemed so sad, but it did not turn out bad  
If you hadn't messed me up I'd still be there  
And I think most folks agree, a little put-down makes them see  
They ain't no chain - just a link and that's why you made me think  
Gonna be somebody - be somebody - be somebody - someday

I damn near had to wreck a ho  
I knocked on the door - ""who is it?""  
It's ice cube, come to pay a little visit to ya  
And what's up with the niggas in the parking lot  
She said fuck em, cause they get sparked alot  
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable  
And then I put my nikes on the coffee table  
Her brother came in he's into gangbangin'  
Cause he walked up and said ""what set you claimin""  
I don't bang I write the good rhymes  
The whole scenery reminded me of good times  
I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut  
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up  
He threw up a set and then he was gone  
I'm thinkin' to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on  
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth  
And fired up the sess it was sess no doubt  
She said please excuse my house and all that  
I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact  
Lookin' at a fucked up black and white  
Her mom's bitchin' cause the county check wasn't right  
She had another brother that was three years old  
And had a bad case of the runny nose  
He asked me who I was then I had to pause  
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers  
I saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked  
Only thirteen and already pregnant  
I grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig  
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids  
They were runnin and playin and cursin and yellin  
And tellin and look at this young punk bailin  
I heard a knock on the door without the password  
And her mom's got the 12 guage mossberg  
The nigga said ""yo, what's for sale""  
And the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo  
She made the drop and got the 20 dollars  
From a smoked out fool with ring around the collar  
The girl I was waiting for came out  
I said bitch I didn't know this was a crack house  
I got my coat and suddenly  
The cop busted in and had a mac-10 pointed to my dome  
And I said to myself once again it's on  
He threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin no slack  
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back  
First he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up  
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up  
I said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take  
Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake  
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope  
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case  
He said get out my face and musta had a grudge  
His reply tell that bullshit to the judge  
The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin  
I said aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin  
She started draggin and all of a sudden  
We all got tossed in the patty wagon  
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point  
I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint  
Now the story you heard has one little object  
Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects!

What's the date and time it don't matter  
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort  
To make a long story short  
Ran into this girl named Carla  
Knew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala  
She said what's up yeah what's the deal  
Check the hairdo of course it ain't real  
Then I looked down she was fat in the front  
I asked how long, well about seven months  
Oh how time flies when you're having fun  
She said yeah but the damage is done  
Where you been, on a little vacation  
Oh by the way congratulations  
Who's the lucky man? I don't have a clue  
Then she said the lucky man is you  
I dropped my brew  
And everything looked fuzzy  
Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy  
She said yeah remember that date  
I thought back and tried to calculate  
Then I said damn are you sure it's mine  
Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times  
She said that day no I wasn't whoring  
Your ass is mine that's when the sweat started pouring  
Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court  
Paying a gang on child support  
Then I thought deep about giving up the money  
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy  
Naw cause then I'd really get faded  
That's murder one cause it was premeditated  
So what I'm a do  
I don't have a clue  
How many months left damn only two  
I'm gettin' faded  
  
No cigar, G  
Ay yo homey man I'm getting faded  
  
It's crazy cause before I could sleep with her  
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her  
See the booty and the front was all in place  
But the girl had the pitbull face  
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid  
Oh lord god forbid  
My homies see me at the motel  
Cause those fools would love to just go tell  
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep  
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept  
And hold your big fat butt steady  
Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready  
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey  
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque  
I dropped her off man and I'm knowing  
That I'm a hate myself in the morning  
I got drunk to help me forget  
Yo another day another hit shit  
I'm gettin' faded  
  
Ay yo you know what time it is  
  
Nine months later she's ready to drop the load  
And everybody in the hood already knows  
It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me  
You know Ice Cube can't be having that G  
I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her  
Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger  
JD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up they won't shut up  
I'm gettin' fed up bitch  
Cause I know you're tryin' to break me  
But if I find out your tryin' to fake me  
I'm a buff that duff for a hoot  
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two  
That night she went into labor  
And the shit is getting kinda major  
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver  
Looking like my next-door neighbor  
She said it was mine that was her best guess  
But let's check the results of the blood test  
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative  
Damn why did I let her live  
After that I should've got the gat  
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap  
But no I just told the hoe who laid me  
Excuse me bitch it's a switch  
You can't fade me  
  
Naw baby not this way  
Yo you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger  
I don't fall for the okey-doke  
And before I fall for the okey-doke  
I let the pistol smoke

Iron Maiden,The Number Of The Beast,/i/iron+maiden/the+number+of+the+beast_10145358.html,"Woe to you, oh earth and sea  
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath  
Because he knows the time is short  
Let him who hath understanding  
Reckon the number of the beast  
For it is a human number  
Its number is six hundred and sixty six  
  
I left alone, my mind was blank, I needed time to think  
To get the memories from my mind  
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw  
That night was real and not just fantasy?  
  
Just what I saw in my old dreams  
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me  
'Cause in my dreams, it's always there  
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair  
  
Night was black, was no use holding back  
'Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?  
In the mist, dark figures move and twist  
Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell?  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
Hell and fire was spawned to be released  
  
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised  
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky  
In the night, the fires are burning bright  
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
Sacrifice is going on tonight  
  
This can't go on, I must inform the law  
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?  
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes  
Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
6 6 6, the one for you and me  
  
I'm coming back, I will return  
And I'll possess your body, and I'll make you burn  
I have the fire, I have the force  
I have the power to make my evil take its course

Iron Maiden,The Thin Line Between Love And Hate,/i/iron+maiden/the+thin+line+between+love+hate_20067952.html,"When a person turns to wrong, is it a want to be, belong?  
Part of things at any cost, at what price a life is lost  
  
At what point do we begin, fighter spirit a will to win  
But what makes a man decide, take the wrong or righteous road  
  
There's a thin line between love and hate  
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad  
There's a grey place between black and white  
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes  
  
We all like to put the blame on society these days  
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings  
  
Sometimes take just more than that to survive be good at heart  
There is evil in some of us no matter what will never change  
  
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever  
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever  
  
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad  
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane  
  
At what age begin to learn of which way out we will turn  
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn  
  
There's a thin line between love and hate  
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad  
There's a grey place between black and white  
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes  
  
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever  
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say  
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way  
  
You watch the world exploding every single night  
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light

Hello to eternity and live for every breath

He can push his own boat as you set up off the track  
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same  
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame

A puppy dog at play  
My heart is filled with envy  
That's because  
My heart is yearning to pass the time away  
Like that pup

And tho' it's wrong to be  
I long to be

I want to be lazy  
I want to be out in the sun  
With no work to be done  
Under that awning  
They call the sky  
Stretching and yawning  
And let the world go drifting by  
I want to peep  
Through the deep  
Tangled wildwood  
Counting sheep  
'Til I sleep  
Like a child would  
With a great big valise full  
Of books to read where it's peaceful  
While I'm  
Killing time  
Being lazy

Life is short  
And getting shorter with each day that goes by  
And how the time does fly  
Before you know, it's over

In such a hurry to pack my things and fly  
To a spot  
Where it's nice and hot  
And hear the birdies sing

I'd much rather sit up in first class  
Should I admit that a slutty b-tch was my first smash  
Was it experience so nah I didn't wear it out  
Always thought my first time would be with someone I cared about  
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed bout  
I used to ask for practice so I wasn't scared out my mind  
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind  
Was just a young boy staring out my blind  
Till I got free from my momma leash  
Running loose through the streets  
Like a stray dog in heat  
And we looking for some freaks can you play  
Pardon me, what's your name, don't mistake me for no lame  
No not me

In the club dappin' n-ggas, even til he are-I-P  
Damn, you win some, you lose some  
That just how it's happens  
And if a n-gga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em  
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom  
It's funny I barely told nobody I started rapping  
Cause see some n-ggas was haters that I viewed as clowns  
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around

Looking so far away  
She can almost feel the southern winds blow  
Gently touching her restless day  
  
She turns from her window to me  
Sad smile her apology  
Sad eyes reaching to the door  
  
Daylight loses to another evening  
And still she spares me the words goodbye  
Sits alone beside me fighting her feelings  
Struggles to speak, but in the end can only cry  
  
Suddenly it's so hard to find  
The sound of the words to speak her troubled mind  
So I'm offering these to her as if to be kind:  
There's a train everyday leaving either way  
There's a world, you know  
There's a way to go  
And you'll soon be gone, it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell  
  
A child's drawings left there on the table  
And a woman's silk lying, on the floor  
I would keep them here if I were able  
To Lock you safe behind this open door  
  
Suddenly it's so clear to me  
That I'd asked you to see what you may never see  
And now my kind words find their way back to me  
There's a train everyday, leaving either way  
There's a world, you know  
You got a way to go

Our love is a fire  
Our love is a wave moving deep in an ocean  
Of need and desire

I play the cards I drew  
No problem with the changes life has hurled

I need your tender touch to heal the night

You look the picture  
Of contented new wealth  
  
But from the on-looking fool  
Who believed your lies  
I wish this grave would open up  
And swallow me alive  
  
For the bitterest pill  
Is hard to swallow  
The love I gave hangs  
In sad colored, mocking shadows  
  
When the wheel of fortune broke  
You fell to me  
Out of gray skies  
To change my misery  
  
The vacant spot  
Your beating heart took its place  
But now I watch smoke  
Leave my lips and fill an empty room

In sad colored, mocking shadows

Twisted and broken dawn  
No days with sunlight  
  
The dying spark  
You left your mark on me  
The promise of your kiss  
But with someone else  
  
For the bitterest pill

The love I gave hangs  
In sad colored, mocking shadows

On a bottle of rum and a lime  
Singin' give me some words I can dance to  
Or a melody that rhymes  
  
First you learn the native custom  
Soon a word of Spanish or two  
You know that you cannot trust them  
Cause they know they can't trust you  
  
Expatriated American feelin' so all alone  
Telling themselves the same lies  
That they told themselves back home  
  
Down to the Banana Republics  
Things aren't as warm as they seem  
None of the natives are buying  
Any second hand American dreams  
  
Late at night you will find them  
In the cheap hotels and bars  
Hustling the senoritas  
While they dance beneath the stars  
Spending those renegade pesos  
On a bottle of rum and a lime  
Singing give me some words I can dance to  
Or a melody that rhymes  
  
Down to the Banana Republics  
Down to the tropical sun  
Go the expatriated Americans  
Hopin' to find some fun

With his best friend Magnus right by his side  
They soared through the Milky Way counting the stars  
Once around Venus, twice around Mars  
  
Then they spied an island rise out of the sea  
They fell back to Earth just as free as you please  
The children all gathered the church bells did ring  
Suddenly everyone started to sing  
  
Chanson pour les petits enfants  
Chanson pour toute le monde  
Chanson pour les petits enfants  
Chanson pour toute le monde  
  
Queen of the island she welcomed them in  
Asking them questions of where they have been  
She offered them chocolate she offered them tea  
They all took their seats in the top of a tree  
  
And raccoon brought wine and the mice they brought cheese  
Beautiful birds floated by on the breeze  
From out in the oceans the dolphins began  
Humming a tune that soon covered the land  
  
Chanson pour les petits enfants  
Chanson pour toute le monde  
Chanson pour les petits enfants  
Chanson pour toute le monde  
  
So young Princess Leah brought coral and pearls  
Gifts to the travelers from some other world  
The Bush doctor mixed up a magical spell  
Swore them to secrecy, never to tell  
  
So young Mr. Moon flew away in the night  
With his best friend Magnus still right by his side  
The sun was just rising, they'd be home by noon  
Humming the words to this magical tune

Jimmy Buffett,False Echoes,/j/jimmy+buffett/false+echoes_20194538.html,"The skies over Cuba turned pink with the light  
And the waterfront ritual began to ignite  
All the ships in the harbor were warmed by the sun  
Twenty-fifth of November, 1921  
  
On the old Chicamauga the Signal Jacks flew  
And the message they spelled out caused a great bally hoo  
Every ship in Havana then hoisted away  
All the pennants were 'a flyin' on my dad's first birthday  
  
Enduring echoes call out from his past  
Time ain't for savin' no time's not for that  
Chasing false echoes like a lost legionnaire  
He waltzes on memories while he fades like a flare  
  
Now his storybook childhood was not make believe  
On the decks of a tall ship he was taught to achieve  
Witnessed storms and starvation natural wonders and force  
Oh the life of a sailor steers a wanderin' course  
  
Enduring echoes call out from his past  
Time ain't for savin' no time's not for that  
Chasing false echoes like a lost legionnaire  
He waltzes on memories while he fades like a flare  
  
Well now life throws us curve balls we never can reach  
He gave up the ocean but he lived by the beach  
Where he raised up his family taught us all to survive  
Then the wind went away in 1995  
  
Now the old Chicamauga has slipped by the ways  
She lies on the bottom of old Mobile Bay  
Where the ghosts of his father and his brother are near  
They protect him and tell him there's nothin' to fear  
Cause it's family tradition we take to the sea  
And it's a time in the future for Cameron and me  
  
Enduring echoes call out from his past  
Time ain't for saving no time's not for that

I wanted to ride on that arrow of fire right up into heaven  
And I wanted to go for every man  
Every child, every mother of children  
I wanted to carry the dreams of all people right up to the stars  
  
And I prayed that I'd find an answer there  
Or maybe I would find a song  
Giving a voice to all of the hearts that cannot be heard  
And for all of the ones who live in fear  
And all of those who stand apart  
My being there would bring us a little step closer together  
  
They were flying for me  
They were flying for everyone  
They were trying to see a brighter day for each and everyone  
  
They gave us their light  
They gave us their spirit and all they could be  
They were flying for me  
They were flying for me  
  
And I wanted to wish upon the Milky Way  
And dance upon a falling star  
I wanted to give myself and free myself, and join myself with it all  
  
Given the chance to dream, it can be done  
The promise of tomorrow is real  
Children of spaceship Earth  
The future belongs to us all

There's comfort in melancholy  
When there's no need to explain  
It's just as natural as the weather  
In this moody sky today  
  
In our possessive coupling  
So much could not be expressed  
So now I'm returning to myself  
These things that you and I suppressed  
  
I see something of myself in everyone  
Just at this moment of the world  
As snow gathers like bolts of lace  
Waltzing on a ballroom girl  
  
You know it never has been easy  
Whether you do or you do not resign  
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities  
Or stick to some straighter line  
  
Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock  
They're either going to thaw out or freeze  
Listen...strains of Benny Goodman  
Coming through' the snow and the pinewood trees  
  
I'm porous with travel fever  
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own  
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger  
Can set up trembling in my bones  
  
I know, no one's going to show me everything  
We all come and go unknown  
Each so deep and superficial  
Between the forceps and the stone  
  
Well I looked at the granite markers  
Those tribute to finality, to eternity  
And then I looked at myself here  
Chicken scratching for my immortality  
  
In the church they light the candles  
And the wax rolls down like tears  
There's the hope and the hopelessness  
I've witnessed thirty years  
  
We're only particles of change I know, I know  
Orbiting around the sun  
But how can I have that point of view  
When I'm always bound and tied to someone  
  
White flags of winter chimneys  
Waving truce against the moon  
In the mirrors of a modern bank  
From the window of a hotel room  
  
I'm traveling in some vehicle  
I'm sitting in some cafe  
A defector from the petty wars  
Until love sucks me back that way

Double yellow line

Maybe it's sensitivity

To be needed by me  
Fresh salmon frying  
And the tide rolling in

'Was very late when I walked in  
My talking as it rambled  
Revealed suspicious reasoning  
The visit seemed to darken him  
I came in as bright  
As a neon light  
And I burned out  
Right there before him  
I told him these things  
I'm telling you now  
Watched them buckle up  
In his brow  
When you dig down deep  
You lose good sleep  
And it makes you  
Heavy company  
I will always love you  
Hands alike  
Magnet and iron  
The souls

Joni Mitchell,The Circle Game,/j/joni+mitchell/the+circle+game_20075378.html,"Yesterday a child came out to wonder  
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar  
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder  
And tearful at the falling of a star  
Then the child moved ten times round the seasons  
Skated over ten clear frozen streams  
Words like, when you're older, must appease him  
And promises of someday make his dreams  
And the seasons they go round and round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return we can only look behind  
From where we came  
And go round and round and round  
In the circle game  
  
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now  
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town  
And they tell him,  
Take your time, it won't be long now  
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down  
And the seasons they go round and round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return we can only look behind  
From where we came  
And go round and round and round  
In the circle game  
  
So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty  
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true  
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty  
Before the last revolving year is through  
And the seasons they go round and round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return, we can only look behind  
From where we came  
And go round and round and round  
In the circle game

Josh Groban,Finishing The Hat,/j/josh+groban/finishing+the+hat_21098325.html,"Yes, she looks for me...good  
Let her look for me  
To tell me why she left me  
As I always knew she would  
  
I had thought she understood  
They have never understood  
And no reason that they should  
  
But if anybody could, finishing the hat  
How you have to finish the hat  
How you watch the rest of the world  
From a window while you finish the hat  
  
Mapping out the sky  
What you feel like, planning the sky  
What you feel when voices that come  
Through the window go  
  
Until they distance and die  
Until there's nothing but sky  
And how you're always turning back too late  
From the grass or the stick  
Or the dog or the light  
  
How the kind of woman willing to wait  
Not the kind that you want to find waiting  
To return you to the night  
Dizzy from the height  
  
Coming from the hat, studying the hat  
Entering the world of the hat  
Reaching through the world of the hat  
Like a window  
Back to this one from that  
  
Studying a face  
Stepping back to look at a face  
Leaves a little space in the way like a window  
But to see it's the only way to see  
  
And when the woman that you wanted goes  
You can say to yourself, ""Well, I give what I give""  
But the women who won't wait for you knows  
That however you live  
  
There's a part of you always standing by  
Mapping out the sky, finishing a hat  
Starting on a hat, finishing a hat  
Look I made a hat  
  
Where there never was a hat

di contare di piu  
  
Che sciocco io  
io che ti ho dato tutto di me  
Ora che vai  
stai portando il mio cuore con te.  
  
Un amore per sempre  
dura solo un istante  
Sono tanti ricordi che  
svaniscono in te  
Resta forse quel sogno  
Una storia di amanti  
ma a la fine vai via  
da me  
  
Questa citta' che mi penso  
deserto di lacrime  
Sento il cuore affogato in me  
Mentre tu sei con lui  
  
Dicono che no si muore nel'amore  
Non perdi mai  
Io mi sento morire ormai  
fuoco dentro di me  
  
So pure che dovrei essere felice per te  
  
Ma, mentirei, perche volgio che resti con me  
  
Un amore per sempre  
Dura solo un istante  
Sono tanti ricordi  
che svaniscono in te  
  
Resta forse quel sogno  
una storia di amanti  
Ma la fine di verlo  
te ne vai, vai con duole

che svaniscono in te  
Resta quel che momento

A church in the rain...a sad congregation  
An old friend I knew  
When I look at the end...I understand now  
I got livin' to do...there's still livin' to do  
  
With every breath, comes deeper meaning  
I don't want to waste, I don't want to waste, one single minute  
Tears fall from the sky, angles are cryin'  
They cry for those...who don't know that they're dyin'  
  
I wait for the sun...a chance at a new day  
There's no time to lose

When I look at the end...I understand now

And all around seems dead and cold

Do not despair, mother nature simply rests  
In sleep she has well earned  
'Til one day not so very far from now

Ahh  
  
Poor Johnny one note sang out with gusto  
And just overlorded the place  
Poor Johnny one note, yelled willy nilly  
Until he was blue in the face  
For holding one note was his ace  
  
Couldn't hear the brass  
Couldn't hear the drum  
He was in a class, by himself, by gum  
  
Poor Johnny one note got in Aida  
Indeed a great chance to be brave  
He took his one note, howled like the north wind  
Brought forth wind that made critics rave  
While Verdi turned 'round in his grave  
  
Couldn't hear the flute  
Or the big trombone  
Every one was mute, Johnny stood alone  
  
Cats and dogs stopped yapping  
Lions in the zoo all were jealous of Johnny's big trill  
Thunder claps stopped clapping  
Traffic ceased its roar and they tell us Niagara stood still  
  
He stopped the train whistles, boat whistles  
Steam whistles, cop whistles  
All whistles bowed to his skill  
Ahh  
  
Sing Johnny one note, sing out with gusto  
And just overlord all the crowd  
So sing Johnny one note, out loud  
Sing Johnny one note  
Sing Johnny one note out loud

The stars have lost their glitter,  
The winds grow colder  
And suddenly you're older,  
And all because of the man that got away.  
  
No more his eager call,  
The writing's on the wall,  
The dreams you dreamed have all  
Gone astray.  
  
The man that won you  
Has gone off and undone you.  
That great beginning  
Has seen the final inning.  
Don't know what happened.  
It's all a crazy game!  
  
No more that all-time thrill,  
For you've been through the mill,  
And never a new love will  
Be the same.  
  
Good riddance, good-bye!  
Every trick of his you're on to.  
But, fools will be fools,  
And where's he gone to?  
  
The road gets rougher,  
It's lonelier and tougher.  
With hope you burn up,  
Tomorrow he may turn up.  
There's just no letup the live-long night and day!  
  
Ever since this world began  
There is nothing sadder than  
A one-man woman looking for  
The man that got away,  
The man that got away.

First Verse:  
  
Last night me and my dogs was hanging out  
Tired of being cramped up in the house  
We were simply celebrating life  
Off from work today, so it's all right  
But all those ups and downs, turned me in a twist  
Started dancing with this model chick  
Then every record became our favorite song  
And that is all that I remember  
  
Chorus:  
  
Cuz I had one too many drinks  
And ended up at the Embassy  
With this pretty little thing, from Memphis Tennessee  
It was a one night extravaganza  
  
Second Verse:  
  
When I woke up from last night's ""salvatry""  
Baby doll was laying next to me  
Shoes and clothes was scattered every where  
I got dress and got up out of there  
But not before I call for me a cab  
Hung over from all the drinks I had  
And now I'm telling my story to you  
Every thing that I remember  
  
Repeat Chorus: 2x

Extravaganza, Extravaganza

Being at the bar  
Trying to ask what that Hpyno hit fo'  
Knowing that I can't afford to get mo'

Buy one bottle and sip slow  
Or, or leave the club now  
Do like I did  
Come back when you get dough  
A fish stick nigga  
Now we messing with lobsters  
We messing with Grammies  
We messing with Oscars  
You messing with that dranky drank  
Plus you puffing on the stanky stank  
In the morning, you g'on draw a blank  
The hotel said that y'all was on one  
My girl wasn't on shit  
I picked the wrong one  
Steady talking about I ain't like them other girls  
Well tonite, I'm trying to find them other girls

Before you ask me to get a job today,  
Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?  
And I know the Government administered AIDS  
So I guess we just pray like the minister say  
Allah O'Akbar and throw 'em some hot cars

But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far  
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars  
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars  
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it

(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only

They say people in your life are seasons  
And anything that happen is for a reason  
And niggas guns a clappin' and keep to squeezin'  
And Gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'  
And Jesus, one day that ya see him  
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him  
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'  
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin'  
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us

You've not done it unto me. depart from me.  
And these shall go away into everlasting fire.  
But the righteous into eternal life!  
And my friends, the only difference between the sheep and the goats,  
According to this scripture,

In this grey world where nobody sings  
I saw the face of a human doll  
Her eyes were glass and her hair was gold  
From her sweet soft lips  
You could hear that song go  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...  
  
In a place where hell is around the corner  
I touched her hand it was baby sweet  
She kissed me there  
I could feel the song going down my throat  
She was singing to me  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...  
  
My daddy said if you want to live  
You better not touch this is not a toy  
The truth is boy I'm a bloody fool  
I left the one I loved behind, singing  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...  
  
Tell me what it is that brings me back to you  
Tell me what it is I can't stop loving you  
Tell me what it is that brings me back to you  
Tell me what it is I can't stop loving you  
  
Nanana nana, nanana nana, ...  
  
So take me back to the land of yours  
Where the black swan loves the one I lost  
My generation sings with the radio on  
The melody of the human doll

My heart yearns for like the desert longing for the rain

Oh I laid myself down to close my eyes

Say that you love me  
Say that you need me  
Say that you want me all the way  
Say that you love me all the way  
  
Why my baby was I made to need so much  
When there's so little out there  
To grasp on to and wipe the tears away  
Oh babe believe me  
It's an endless longing for one's love  
Why do I dream for so much  
When I know

With a voice some lone drown out goodbye.  
I thought there's so little love in the world

With all of those millions of lonely boys and girls  
Why is there so little love in the world.

Kris Kristofferson,Daddy's Song,/k/kris+kristofferson/daddys+song_20080577.html,"I got a day without nothing to do  
And a ""do not disturb"" on my door  
I sorta looked for some mess that she'd made  
Or her sweet little socks on the floor  
But all that she left here was too many rooms  
And just enough silence to break  
And I can't look at her picture right now  
Time's about all I can take.  
Last night I sewed up her toys that were torn  
And packed her suitcase again  
She looked so sweet as she lay there asleep  
Smiling and holding my hand  
We didn't talk all the way to the plane  
But she's too big now to cry  
Then when I kissed her, she held me so tight  
I couldn't tell her goodbye.  
Chorus:  
She said, ""I wish that we lived together again  
It gets so lonesome apart  
I'm missing somebody all of the time  
Daddy, it's breaking my heart""  
It's not so bad out here living alone  
Comfort's a stranger away  
And there's a freedom you find on your own  
That's nearly worth what you pay  
It's just a shame she still wants us to be  
All that we seemed to before  
But we can't blame her for making believe  
Something we don't anymore.

Squeeze a little pleasure from the gold love and glory  
We can take it easy when we're old  
He said we'll take us into town lay our money down

At a tavern called the Sabre and the Rose  
We swang into the saddle sick as breathing  
And slapped 'em once for pleasure with the reins  
The horses snorted frosty in the moonlight  
Somethin' dark was singing in my veins older than the voices in my brain  
He said this place you're gonna see is why they live and breathe  
And sink down a little bit deeper everyday  
And sometimes at night when the wind is running right  
You can hear it suckin' thirty miles away  
Then the light was crimson and I found her all naked and eternal and insane  
Secred as the mysteries around her like a veil nothin' but her prison was
profane  
All we had in common was our chains  
Oh burn it down boys burn it to the ground boys burn it on down  
Feet hit the ground feet leavin' town quicker than a bullet or a knife  
All there was she ran holdin' to my hand runnin' for the river and our life  
Slidin' from the moonlight into shadows silent as the river as it flows  
Swimmin' to the place they'll never find us all we left behind us was our

To just pass me by  
When I think I'll grow old  
It just makes me cry

My father was a dresser of hair  
My mother was a girl you could call on  
When you called she was always there [Repeat: x5]  
  
Ah but don't go home with your hard-on  
It will only drive you insane  
You can't shake it (or break it) with your Motown  
You can't melt it down in the rain  
  
You can't melt it down in the rain  
You can't melt it down in the rain

That smile you down to you knees  
And the lips that say, Come on, taste us  
And when you try to they make you say Please  
  
When you try to they make you say Please  
When you try to they make you say Please  
When you try to they make you say Please

Leonard Cohen,Field Commander Cohen,/l/leonard+cohen/field+commander+cohen_20082828.html,"Field Commander Cohen, he was our most important spy.  
Wounded in the line of duty,  
Parachuting acid into diplomatic cocktail parties,  
Urging Fidel Castro to abandon fields and castles.  
Leave it all and like a man,  
Come back to nothing special,  
Such as waiting rooms and ticket lines,  
Silver bullet suicides,  
And messianic ocean tides,  
And racial roller-coaster rides  
And other forms of boredom advertised as poetry.  
I know you need your sleep now,  
I know your life's been hard.  
But many men are falling,  
Where you promised to stand guard.  
  
I never asked but I heard you cast your lot along with the poor.  
But then I overheard your prayer,  
That you be this and nothing more  
Than just some grateful faithful woman's favorite singing millionaire,  
The patron Saint of envy and the grocer of despair,  
Working for the Yankee Dollar.  
  
I know you need your sleep now  
  
Ah, lover come and lie with me, if my lover is who you are,  
And be your sweetest self awhile until I ask for more, my child.  
Then let the other selves be wrong, yeah, let them manifest and come  
Till every taste is on the tongue,  
Till love is pierced and love is hung,  
And every kind of freedom done, then oh,  
Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love,  
Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love.

Leonard Cohen,"God Is Alive, Magic Is Afoot",/l/leonard+cohen/god+is+alive+magic+is+afoot_20589896.html,"(Lyrics: Cohen, Recorded By Buffy Sainte-Marie)  
  
God is alive, magic is afoot  
God is alive, magic is afoot  
God is alive, magic is afoot  
God is afoot, magic is alive  
Alive is afoot, magic never died  
God never sickened  
Many poor men lied  
Many sick men lied  
Magic never weakened  
Magic never hid  
Magic always ruled  
God is afoot, God never died  
God was ruler  
Though his funeral lengthened  
Though his mourners thickened  
Magic never fled  
Though his shrouds were hoisted  
The naked God did live  
Though his words were twisted  
The naked magic thrived  
Though his death was published  
Round and round the world  
The heart did not believe  
  
Many hurt men wondered  
Many struck men bled  
Magic never faltered  
Magic always lead  
Many stones were rolled  
But God would not lie down  
Many wild men lied  
Many fat men listened  
Though they offered stones  
Magic still was fed  
Though they locked their coffers  
God was always served  
Magic is afoot, God is alive  
Alive is afoot  
  
Alive is in command  
Many weak men hungered  
Many strong men thrived  
Though they boast of solitude  
God was at their side  
Nor the dreamer in his cell  
Nor the captain on the hill  
Magic is alive  
Though his death was pardoned  
Round and round the world  
The heart would not believe  
  
Though laws were carved in marble  
They could not shelter men  
Though altars built in parliaments  
They could not order men  
Police arrested magic and magic went with them  
Mmmmm.... For magic loves the hungry  
But magic would not tarry  
It moves from arm to arm  
It would not stay with them  
Magic is afoot  
It cannot come to harm  
It rests in an empty palm  
It spawns in an empty mind  
But magic is no instrument  
Magic is the end  
Many men drove magic  
But magic stayed behind  
Many strong men lied  
They only passed through magic  
And out the other side  
Many weak men lied  
They came to God in secret  
And though they left Him nourished  
They would not tell who healed  
Though mountains danced before them  
They said that God was dead  
Though his shrouds were hoisted  
The naked God did live  
This I mean to whisper to my mind  
This I mean to laugh within my mind  
This I mean my mind to serve  
Til' service is but magic  
Moving through the world  
And mind itself is magic  
Coursing through the flesh  
And flesh itself is magic  
Dancing on a clock  
And time itself  
The magic length of God

Quickened with passion and with pain  
We rise to play a greater part.  
This is the faith from which we start:  
Men shall know commonwealth again  
From bitter searching of the heart.  
We loved the easy and the smart,  
But now, with keener hand and brain,  
We rise to play a greater part.  
The lesser loyalties depart,  
And neither race nor creed remain  
From bitter searching of the heart.  
Not steering by the venal chart  
That tricked the mass for private gain,  
We rise to play a greater part.  
Reshaping narrow law and art  
Whose symbols are the millions slain,  
From bitter searching of the heart  
We rise to play a greater part.

Now it seems  
This is how the story ends

Not for long  
I can see the way this ends  
He's going to turn me down  
And say ""Can't we be friends?""  
  
Never again  
Through with love  
Through with men  
They play their game without shame  
And who's to blame?  
  
I thought I found a man I could trust  
What a bust  
This is how the story ends  
He's going to turn me down  
And say ""Can't we be friends?""  
  
Why should I care  
Though he gave me the air?  
And why should I cry?  
Even sigh  
Or wonder why?

So much I've never broken through.  
And when I feel you near me,sometimes I see so clearly.  
That only truth I'll never know is me and you.  
  
Look at this man so blessed with inspiration.  
Look at this soul still searching for salvation.

Years of clawing at scars that never healed  
Drowning my mind, the thoughts are too real  
  
Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?  
Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?  
  
Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me  
After everything, you still want me to bleed  
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes  
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive  
  
I can't get out, I can't jump out  
Too much to face, I can't erase

Trying to relate  
To normal feelings and the nighttime reeling  
And some absinthe drunk so late

Onto the size of dessert plates

While my looks still hold me straight

Of reality mixed with drink

Tried to sabotage my mission

And, whispering your name,

And wake me up when this is over

And that's where you stood out from everybody else  
Shikaiya  
That's what your about and you should never lose yourself  
Shikaiya  
Down the phone years and miles apart  
We try to find the magic we used to bounce from heart to heart  
But you don't seem to believe in anything today  
I wonder if your dreams got smashed  
Upon the rocks of that old bay  
You made me feel like everything was beautiful  
And that's where you stood out from everybody else  
Shikaiya  
And that's what your about and you should never lose yourself

Far off in some distant land  
Or it may have been upon some foreign shore  
Burning in my heart again  
  
I've seen the sounds and I have felt the air  
Drumming in my dreams again  
Deja vu I don't know now or then  
Enemy or maybe friend  
  
Oh but for the love of freedom  
Oh but for the love of you  
I would never, ever have seen this day  
So please forgive me if I weep no more  
For friends and lovers far away  
  
There's been too many times to hear the names  
Of friends who have stayed away  
Maybe now and then you still recall the pain  
As though it was yesterday  
  
Oh but for the love of freedom  
Oh but for the love of you  
I would never, ever have seen this day  
So please forgive me if I weep no more  
For friends and lovers far away

But I don't show it,  
But it's like she's looking through me,

They've managed to get rid of me,  
Returned me to the grave  
Ect, electric chair, we shock who we can't save.  
They've cleared you of my memory and many more as well.  
You may have wanted some of them but who can ever tell?  
Your brainwaves are more regular, the chemistry more pure.  
The headaches and the nausea will pass and you'll endure.  
You son is gone forever though, of that the doctor's sure.  
The memories will wane,  
The aftershocks remain.  
You wonder which is worse, the symptom or the cure.  
  
They've managed to get rid of me, I'm gone without a trace,  
But sear the soul and leave scar no treatment can erase.  
They've cut away the cancer but forgot to fill the hole.  
They removed me from your memory, I'm still there in your soul.  
Your life goes back to normal now, or so they all believe.  
Your heart is in your chest again, not hanging from your sleeve.  
They've driven out the demons and they've earned you this reprieve.  
The memories are gone.  
The aftershocks live on.  
But with nothing to remember,  
Is there nothing left to grieve?

With nothing to remember...

My lady of the various sorrows  
Some begged, some borrowed, some stolen  
Some kept safe for tomorrow  
On and endless night, silver star spangled

Do you love me? do you love me?  
Do you love me? do you love me?

And I stacked all my accomplishments beside her  
Still I seemed so obsolete and small  
I found god and all his devils inside her  
In my bed she cast the blizzard out  
A mock sun blazed upon her head  
So completely filled with light she was  
Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad  
Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled  
And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle

She had a heart full of love and devotion  
She had a mindful of tyranny and terror  
Well, I try, I do, I really try  
But I just err, baby, I do, I error  
So come find me, my darling one  
I'm down to the grounds, the very dregs  
Ah, here she comes, blocking the sun  
Blood running down the inside of her legs  
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled  
Band the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle

All things move toward their end  
I knew before I met her that I would lose her  
I swear I made every effort to be good to her  
I made every effort not to abuse her  
Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles

Play that lute of thine

There she was the maiden so divine  
How could I approach her with my outlook so poor  
Her beauty being much more than I could endure

With a language of ancient and of lore  
Gathered the men around us me and the girl in rags  
Soon were the melodies heard by everyone

Watch us dance  
Sing with us this tale

Baby's lookin' finer than a fifty dollar bill  
Pretty blue eyes and it isn't hard to see  
That baby's got a hold on me  
  
Long blond hair down the middle of her back  
She's got the keys to her daddy's Cadillac  
Got every little thing that I'm ever gonna need  
Baby's got a hold on me  
  
Got a hold on, got a hold on me  
Got a hold on, baby's got a hold on me  
  
We've got a full tank of gas, lookin' for a thrill  
A three day weekend, lot of time to kill  
Put the top down but we're never gonna freeze  
'Cause baby's got a hold on me  
  
Got a hold on, got a hold on me  
Got a hold on, baby's got a hold on me  
Hold on...  
  
Well, the full moon's shinin' on a Carolina night  
Drivin' my girl across the interstate line  
Got a preacher waitin' and that's how it's gonna be  
'Cause baby's got a hold on me  
  
Got a hold on, got a hold on me  
Got a hold on, baby's got a hold on me

And being jealous about someone like you  
Is sort of foolish too  
The life you choose is the life you want I guess

The longest day I live I'll still be sufferin' from the shame  
While in the gutter you were makin' yourself quite a name  
The loneliness is all that I regret  
Losin' you might be the best thing yet  
  
Patiently I sit at home and wait,wonderin' where you are  
And what you are doin' has turned my love to hate  
I wanted you and you wanted anyone you could get  
Losin' you might be the best thing yet

Notorious B.I.G.,Ten Crack Commandments,/n/notorious+big/ten+crack+commandments_20101868.html,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
  
It's the ten crack commandments, what?  
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke  
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, my hustlin' niggas  
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas  
  
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal  
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual  
A step-by-step booklet for you to get  
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back  
Rule Number Uno, never let no one know  
How much dough you hold cause you know  
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially  
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up  
Number 2, never let 'em know your next move  
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?  
Take it from your highness  
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for their bricks and chips  
Number 3, never trust no-bo-dy  
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up  
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck  
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up  
Number 4, I know you heard this before  
Never get high on your own supply  
Number 5, never sell no crack where you rest at  
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em bounce!  
Number 6, that goddamn credit? Dead it  
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!  
7, this rule is so underrated  
Keep your family and business completely separated  
Money and blood don't mix like 2 dicks and no bitch  
Find yourself in serious shit  
Number 8, never keep no weight on you!  
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too  
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me,  
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police  
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen  
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'  
Number 10, a strong word called consignment  
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen  
If you ain't got the clientele, say ""hell no!""  
'Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow  
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up  
If not, 24 years on the wake up  
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up  
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed  
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks  
She sniffed a whole half of cake up  
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up  
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up

Oriunde-n noapte sau zi te voi gasi  
In sinea mea cand voi iubi  
  
In fiece seara cand incerc sa adorm,  
Plang si ascult piesa el preferata,  
Caci ma faces-o simt atat de aproape  
Imi aminteste de noi si de ultima noapte  
Ultimul sarut pe buzele reci  
Il simt tremurand cu gura amara  
Te sarut in vis nopti intregi!  
Ca pe o fantoma reala din ultima vara

Ca un vis,ca o poveste disparuta in nori

Under sheets of haze  
  
Somewhere down there with the crashing waves

Nothing gonna touch you when you've said goodbye

I would like to be a martyr  
Over time it's getting harder  
Who do I have to go and kill  
To get my face on a dollar bill.  
[chorus 1]  
Every single time I look  
Someone else has beat me to it  
Some poor bastard bites the dust  
I really don't know who to trust.  
But there's one thing I can't deny  
I'd rather it was me they fried  
Have a drink from an empty cup  
Light a match and burn me up.  
[verse 2]  
I'm exhausted, I'm committed,  
I'm outsmarted, I'm out witted.  
My head's filled with dynamite  
It's coming out of my ears at night.  
[chorus 2]  
I think I am being watched  
Electric eyes that never turn off.  
Radar beams insinuating  
Evil thoughts while I'm masturbating.  
And even my old trinitron,  
It's comin through when nothing's on.  
Have a drink from an empty cup,  
Light a match and burn me up.

Oingo Boingo,Just Another Day,/o/oingo+boingo/just+another+day_20102758.html,"There's life underground...  
  
I feel it all around,  
I feel it in my bones,  
My life is on the line,  
When I'm away from home.  
When I step out the door,  
The jungle is alive...  
I do not trust my ears,  
I don't believe my eyes.  
I will not fall in love,  
I cannot risk the bet,  
Cause hearts are fragile toys,  
So easy to forget.  
  
It's just another day,  
There's murder in the air...  
It drags me when I walk,  
I smell it everywhere.  
It's just another day,  
Where people cling to light,  
To drive away the fear,  
That comes with every night...  
  
It's just another-

It's just another day,  
When people wake from dreams,  
With voices in their ears,  
That will not go away...  
  
I had a dream last night,  
The world was set on fire.  
And everywhere I ran,  
There wasn't any water...  
The temperature increased,  
The sky was crimson red,  
The clouds turned into smoke,  
And everyone was dead.  
  
But there's a smile on my face,  
For everyone...  
There's a golden coin,  
That reflects the sun...  
There's a lonely place,  
That's always cold...  
There's a place in the stars,  
For when you get old.  
  
Oh...  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...  
  
It's just another-  
It's just another day...  
It's just another  
It's just another day...  
Oh...  
  
There's razors in my bed,  
That come out late at night.  
They always disappear,  
Before the morning light!  
I'm dreaming again,  
Of life underground...  
It doesn't ever move,  
It doesn't make a sound.  
  
And just when I think  
That things are in their place,  
The heavens are secure,  
The whole thing explodes in my face!  
  
It's just another-  
It's just another day...  
It's just another day,  
It's just another day...  
It's just another-

Another man's arms holding you tight  
Nobody knows what I feel inside  
All I know, I walked away and cried  
  
I've got dreams  
Dreams to remember (Listen to me)  
I've got dreams, rough dreams  
Dreams to remember  
  
I know you said he was just a friend  
But I saw him kiss you again and again  
These eyes of mine, they don't fool me  
Why did he hold you so tenderly?  
  
I've got dreams  
Dreams to remember (Listen honey)  
I've got dreams, rough dreams

I still want you to stay  
I still love you anyway  
I don't want you to ever leave  
Girl, you just satisfy me, ooo wee  
  
I know you said he was just a friend  
But I saw you kiss him again and again  
These eyes of mine, they don't fool me  
Why did he hold you so tenderly?

Dreams to remember (Listen to me mama)  
I've got dreams, bad dreams, rough dreams oh  
To remember  
Don't make me suffer  
Don't let me

Out Of Eden,Paradise,/o/out+of+eden/paradise_20295637.html,"I tuned in to the tv once again today  
Watch the news to educate my mind  
The destruction and the chaos that confronted me  
It's our world caught in it's own demise  
(As I sat there I began to cry)  
The situation worsens every day that goes by  
(And I thought how can this be, Lord why)  
So heavy on me all those that are hurting inside  
  
If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken  
For every word of love unspoken  
For every childhood dream that's never realize  
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing  
And all the ways we could be moving on  
Maybe I could buy you paradise  
Just to see some hope in your eyes  
  
Sometimes life it seems a bit too much for me  
More things we must survive on top of all that we had before  
Broken hearts, broken homes, kids abused left alone  
So many in the streets, homeless with no food to eat  
(I know God hears us crying out)  
Run to Him for all the answers, don't turn away  
(If we look to Him there is no doubt)  
He'll give us all the help we need, he knows the way, still if I  
  
If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken  
For every word of love unspoken  
For every childhood dream that's never realize  
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing  
And all the ways we could be moving on  
Maybe I could buy you paradise  
Just to see some hope in your eyes  
  
There are so many troubles, God knows what we need to do  
He has us in His hands, knows what we are going through  
Silver and gold have I none, what I have I give to you  
His word says we can make it and I know His word is true  
Here's to the hurting souls and for all the broken hearts  
All those who've been abused, who's life has been torn apart  
I don't have all the answers, what I have I gladly give  
It's in him there is life, if in him we live and if I  
  
If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken  
For every word of love unspoken  
For every childhood dream that's never realize  
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing

Out Of Eden,Secret,/o/out+of+eden/secret_20177122.html,"Chorus:  
Why is that smile upon your face  
When it's such a rainy day  
Why are you so happy?  
What do you know that I don't know?  
I wish I did but aint been told  
So tell me, what's your secret?  
I met a girl the other day at the supermarket  
Ringing up all of my things  
She had the strangest look upon her face  
Wish you could have been there  
Just to see the way she looked at me  
Thought I must look crazy something out of place  
But paid it no attention  
Just kept going with my business  
I looked up because she stepped into my space  
Saw pain in her eyes  
Her question took me by surprise she said  
I didn't have the faintest clue where to begin  
So I asked some questions (just to see what I was dealing with)  
She told me where she was and where it was she'd been  
What an awful tale life hadnt done her well  
She had thoughts of leaving  
Bridge:  
(Before you go) let me tell my story  
(Once like you, you know) all guts and no glory  
(But now I have joy) the reason why  
Whos in my life  
That is why you're asking me  
See the moral of the story is the whole worlds watching you  
So be careful what you say and be careful what you do  
Never know when it will be your time to show someone the way  
So be a guiding light and shine so they'll say

To make his whole crew believers you're harder than a bitch full of dicks

See now in the ghetto or should I say Lakewood  
You better be strapped 'cause them niggas over there just ain't good  
Just being a hustler, serving on all your customers  
Rent was due on the 1st of the month so I'm hustling  
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo

Try to catch up with massah  
I used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus of them crackers

Principalities, powers of this world  
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness  
In high places, so throw that whole armor of righteousness

This day will be done right  
There is a war, just waiting on the other side of the door  
But I'll be bringing God to the gunfight  
Can't live forever, so have some fun, right  
Life's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right  
You can handle if tomorrow never comes, right  
You'll get used to singing if only for one night  
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son right  
And I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless  
And see I focus to provoke this  
So open wide for my opinionated opus  
Stop playing Go Fish, but not below this  
Before I go, I thought that you all should know this  
Recognize and realize before any regretting  
Before you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting

She bursted it out in crying

And Barbara in the new one

I took a walk along the riverbank of my imagination  
Golden clouds were shuffling the sunshine  
  
But if I ever get back to the twentieth century  
Guess I'll have to pay off some debts  
Open the book of my vanishing memory  
With its catalogue of regrets  
Stand up for the deeds I did  
And those I didn't do  
Sit down, shut up, think about God  
And wait for the hour of my rescue  
  
We don't mean to mess things up  
But mess them up we do  
And then it's ""Oh, I'm sorry""  
Here's a smiling photograph of love it was new  
At a birthday party  
  
Make a wish and close your eyes: surprise, surprise, surprise.  
  
Early December, and brown as a sparrow  
Frost creeping over the pond  
I shoot a thought into the future  
And it flies like an arrow  
Through my lifetime, and beyond  
  
If I ever come back as a tree, or a crow  
Or even the wind-blown dust  
Find me on the ancient road in the song when the wires are hushed  
Hurry on and remember me, as I'll remember you  
Far above the golden clouds, the darkness vibrates  
  
The earth is blue  
  
And everything about it is a love song  
Everything about it  
Everything about it is a love song  
Everything about it

I'm one of the best, one of the rawest  
Nah I ain't perfect but bitch I'm flawless  
Nah I ain't stupid but the flow is retarded  
Barely made high school, the streets was my college  
Rappin here for years, workin and grindin  
On the streets if you copped it, I supplied it  
I've worked everything, every drug you name it  
I've seen families get tied up for missin payments  
Keep thinking that this thing is just entertainment  
Disrepect, get introduced to the pavement  
Catch me somewhere on the islands of Caymen  
Me, I see the future, ya'll boys cavemen  
Now it's cartoons and tv shows  
First album gold, remix did for, El Mariel in stores  
I hustle (I hustle), I grind (I grind),  
That's why they call me Mr. 305

Lovers come and go, friends bought and sold, everything blows away

I just can't bear the thought  
Of hurting Him  
It seems that I'm so good  
At breaking promises  
And I treat His precious grace  
So carelessly  
But each time He forgives  
What if He relives  
The agony He felt on that tree?  
Does He still feel the nails  
Every time I fail?  
Does He hear the crowd cry  
Crucify, again?  
Am I causing Him pain?  
Then I know I've got to change  
I just can't bear the thought  
Of hurting Him  
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord  
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord  
Do you still feel the nails  
Every time I fail?  
Have I crucified you, Jesus  
With my sin?  
I'm tired of playing games  
I really want to change  
I never want to hurt You again  
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord  
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord

Words and music by Ray Boltz  
Chorus:  
Hey, little brother, welcome back home  
It's good to see you again  
Hey, little brother, welcome back home  
To your family and your friends  
Chorus  
Now you do not know  
What your Father's been through  
At night He would call out your name  
Then for hours untold  
He would stare down the road  
Praying you'd come home again  
Chorus  
I must confess I was quite envious  
When I heard what Father planned to do  
But after I talked to Him  
I realized I had been  
Almost as far from home as you  
I was almost as far from home as you, so  
  
Chorus  
Oh, dear brother run into my arms  
And tell me you are home to stay  
For there is no other Father like ours  
And we're so glad you're here today  
Yes, we're so glad you're here today  
Chorus (repeat)

Just a half

Might think

It's bad out there

What's in this drink?  
No cabs  
To be had out there  
I wish I knew how  
Your eyes  
Are like starlight now  
To break the spell  
I'll take your hat  
Your hair looks swell  
  
I ought to say  
No, no, no sir

Mmove in closer?  
At least I'm gonna say  
That I tried

Hurtin' my pride?

You'll freeze out there  
Say, lend me your coat  
It's up  
To your knees out there  
You've really been grand  
I thrill  
When you touch my hand  
But don't you see  
How can you do  
This thing to me  
  
There's bound  
To be talk tomorrow  
Think  
Of my lifelong sorrow  
At least there  
Will be plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia  
And died

Get over that old lie

Corner of the same old parking lot  
Half the hugs and kisses there are always sad  
We trade a couple words and looks  
And kids again  
Every other weekend  
  
Every other weekend  
Very few exceptions  
I pick up the love we made in both my arms  
It's movies on the sofa  
Grilled cheese and cut the crust off  
But that's not the way mom makes it, Daddy breaks my heart  
I miss everything we used to have with her again

I can't tell him I love him

Fallin' for forever was a big mistake  
There's so much not to do and all day not do it in

Every other Sunday  
I empty out my backseat  
While my children hug their mother in the parking lot  
We don't touch, we don't talk much  
Maybe goodbye to each other  
As she drives away with every piece of heart I've got  
I re-convince myself we did the right thing

Grandpa's

And if Trevor and E.P. would quit fighting long enough and be real quiet  
This little song might help ya understand  
Long ago in a stable there was a baby being born  
His parents were Joseph and Mary  
And Joseph's big ole heart was torn  
Cause he couldn't find a decent place for Mary to have her child  
But Mary said it just seemed just right and she blessed it with her  
Smile  
Cause what made it special was the baby in her arms  
God sent Him down to give the world a second chance for you and I  
That's why we have Christmas at this time each year  
It's the baby's birthday party that brings us so much cheer  
Now kids the presents that all of you exchange on Christmas  
Represents the gifts that baby Jesus received the night he was born  
He got all his presents from three wise men  
Who followed a star  
And walked a long long way to the stable  
So everytime you tear open one of your presents  
Think about that baby and say  
Happy birthday Jesus  
I'll open this one for you

Going to the jungle where the elephant roams  
Got to get away gonna make it my home  
  
Losing my taste for the human race  
Social grace is a waste of time

So sublime that we blow my mind

Runnin' through the woods laughin' at the blues

In the waterfall I just want to play

As I look back on what I thought was living  
I'm amazed at the price I choose to pay  
And to think I ignored what really mattered  
Cause I thought the sacrifice would be too great  
But when I finally reached the point of giving in  
I found the cross was calling even then  
And even though it took dying to survive  
I've never felt so much alive.  
  
Chorus:  
  
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live  
Not I but Christ that lives within me  
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give  
For it's not my strength but His  
There's no greater sacrifice  
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live  
  
Verse 2:  
  
As I hear the Savior call for daily dying  
I will bow beneath the weight of Calvary  
Let my hands surrender to His piercing purpose  
That holds be to the cross yet sets me free  
I will glory in the power of the cross  
The things I thought were gain I count as loss  
And with His suffering I identify  
And by His resurrection power I am alive

I can't remember what I did  
Us in bed a made n' veil basement  
When you left  
Western winter  
I hear clatter  
Morning dawning  
Nothing matters  
  
When we took a cab  
Back when cabs had somewhere to go  
And we meet the stars  
When the stars were people you'd want to know  
We were new to fame  
I'm so glad you came  
  
Some of us fell by the wayside  
Others had it and threw it away  
Some caried on pretending  
They think they still have it today  
The once admired  
Look oh so tired  
Loose it on  
In the night time  
  
And we took a cab  
Back when cabs had somewhere to go  
And we'd meet the stars  
When the stars were people you'd want to know  
We were new to fame  
I'm so glad I came  
  
Took me years to find my own song  
And for years I've thought just sing along  
But the words that were wrong  
The tune that's true lives on and on  
They'll still be here when I'm gone  
  
And we took a cab  
Back when cabs had somewhere to go  
And we'd meet the stars  
When the stars were people you'd want to know

Together we could fulfill each other's life dream  
We both Gemini so we got 2 sides  
Our zodiac sign is the perfect sign  
Cuz she replied, ""All Gemini's lie""  
I guess this is what it feels like when doves cry  
Your attitude is deep cover  
Won't give me the number  
Cold play me out like a foul, a bleep or a blunder  
It's like a burnin' in the chest, a cardiac arrest  
You look like you havin' fun puttin' me thru stress  
So in between time and in the meantime  
You do your thing and I do mine  
But don't play wit my mind

Won't you please get naughty with me  
And if you really wanna  
I can be your fantasy  
You are so afraid, oh baby

And his future was doomed

Till the moment arrives

Just one spark of decency  
Against a starless night  
One glow of hope and dignity  
A child can follow the light  
No matter what they say  
No matter what they say...  
  
If the future's looking dark  
We're the ones who have to shine  
If there's no one in control  
We're the ones who draw the line  
Though we live in trying times  
We're the ones who have to try  
Though we know that time has wings  
We're the ones who have to fly

I look in the mirror i still look the same  
I'm striking matches it's morning again  
I look in the mirror i go up in flames  
  
Striking matches getting a flame on the stove  
There's some of her in the teeth of my comb  
Dirty clothes piled up on the bathroom floor  
She's silently sleeping, i half close the door  
I see her beauty laying on my bed  
I'm warm from within me with what she has said  
Her love is my balloon, i won't let it down  
For ever and ever I'll always be proud.  
  
I'm a director casting for a part  
(turn on the light)  
It's for a soap set here right in my heart.  
(leave her alone)  
Shuffle to the window shuffle to the door  
(don't wake her up)  
She gets the part i don't want to see anymore

Squeeze,The Waiting Game,/s/squeeze/the+waiting+game_20129060.html,"I heard the stomping of feet dancing  
On the wooden floor upstairs  
I wasn't in the mood for laughing  
So I sat silent in my chair  
There was someone missing I knew  
Outside there fell the rain  
Where had she gone, what could I do  
I played the waiting game  
The cigarette smoke was annoying  
My mood was fit for a bath  
A drink couldn't oil my expression  
Nothing could've made me laugh  
I was worried out of my head  
I was in such a state  
What's keeping her, where has she gone  
I played the waiting game  
When you love someone  
You worry when they're late  
When you trust someone  
You know the time it takes  
To play the waiting game  
The music got louder and louder  
From the wooden floor upstairs  
I played with a handful of peanuts  
Then I saw her standing there  
My mood leapt right out of the bath  
She had got stuck in the rain  
Her coat dripped on a hanger  
Playing the waiting  
I couldn't understand her  
Playing the waiting  
Seemed like I'd wait forever  
Playing the waiting game

Though all my kingdoms turn to sand  
And fall into the sea

The vanity of an ancient king  
But the city lies in broken pieces  
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing  
These are the works of man

It means nothing to me  
There are no victories  
In all our histories, without love  
A stone's throw from Jerusalem  
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight  
And though a million stars were shining  
My heart was lost on a distant planet  
That whirls around the April moon  
Whirling in an arc of sadness  
I'm lost without you. I'm lost without you  
And though you hold the keys to ruin  
Of everything I see  
With every prison blown to dust,  
My enemies walk free  
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand  
And fall into the sea  
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you

Looking everywhere haven't found her yet  
  
She's the big affair I cannot forget  
Only girl I ever think of with regret  
I'd like to add her initial to my monogram  
Tell me where is the shepherdess for this lost lamb?  
  
There's a somebody I'm longing to see  
I hope that she turns out to be  
Someone who'll watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood  
I know I could always be good  
To one who'll watch over me  
Although I may not be the man some girls think of as handsome  
  
To her heart I carry the key  
Won't you tell her please to put on some speed, follow my lead  
Oh, how I need someone who'll watch over me

I couldn't live without you

Here in the cold of December  
And now you're in the arms of someone else

This was always second best  
Our love would fall at the first test  
Common sense would tell us we were wrong  
This was never meant to be  
  
This was never meant to last

From the first moment that we met I knew  
Now Miss, from our first kiss

Hard it was to say the names  
Of mirror dreams and cheated games  
And on the wall  
You framed your first lover  
  
Your form intrigues me with the glow

Though I forgot to lock the chain  
Around you with a prayer for rain  
To bring the call  
To drive you back into my bed

Telling me to follow for a while

Will my taste stay grey and blue  
If I try to turn from you

Tom Lehrer,Oedipus Rex,/t/tom+lehrer/oedipus+rex_20138385.html,"From the Bible to the popular song  
There's one theme that we find right along  
Of all ideals they hail as good  
The most sublime is motherhood  
There was a man though, who it seems  
Once carried this ideal to extremes  
He loved his mother and she loved him  
And yet his story is rather grim  
  
There once lived a man named Oedipus Rex  
You may have heard about his odd complex  
His name appears in Freud's Index 'cause he  
Loved his mother!  
His rivals used to say quite a bit that  
As a monarch he was most unfit,  
But still and all they had to admit that he  
Loved his Mother!  
  
Yes he loved his mother like no other  
His daughter was his sister  
and his son was his brother  
One thing on which you can depend is  
He sure knew who a boy's best friend is  
When he found what he had done  
He tore his eyes out one by one  
A tragic end to a loyal son who  
Loved his mother  
  
So be sweet and kind to Mother,  
Now and then have a chat  
Buy her candy or some flowers,  
Or a brand new hat  
But, maybe you had better let it go at that  
Or you may find yourself with a quite complex complex  
And  
You may end up like Oedipus  
(I'd rather marry a duck-billed platypus)  
Then end up like old Oedipus Rex!

Tom Waits,New Year's Eve,/t/tom+waits/new+years+eve_20981593.html,"The door was open, I was seething  
Your mother burst in it was freezing  
She said it looks like it's trying to rain  
I was lost, I felt sea sick  
You convinced me that he'd left  
You said keep talking but don't use their names  
I scolded your driver and your brother  
We are old enough to know how long you've been hooked  
And we've all been through the war  
And each time you score  
Someone gets hauled and handcuffed and booked  
  
It felt like four in the morning  
What sounded like fire works  
Turned out to be just what it was  
The stars looked like diamonds  
Then came the sirens  
And everyone started to cuss  
  
All the noise was disturbing  
And I couldn't find Irving  
It was like two stations on at the same time  
And then I hid your car keys  
And I made black coffee  
And I dumped out the rest of the rum  
  
Nick and Socorro broke up  
And Candice wouldn't shut up  
Fin he recorded the whole thing  
Ray he said damn you  
And someone broke my camera  
And it was New Years  
And we all started to sing  
  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot for the sake of auld lang syne  
  
I was leaving in the morning with Charles for Las Vegas  
And I didn't plan to come back  
I had only a few things  
Two hundred dollars  
And my records in a brown paper sack  
  
I ran out on Sheila  
Everything's in storage  
Calvin's right I should go back to driving truck  
  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot for the sake of auld lang syne

In an army's strength therein  
Lies the denouement. From  
Here you're haunting me. By  
The Seine so beautiful, only  
Not to be of use, impossible.  
So strange, victory, 1200 spires  
The only sound, moscow burning.  
Empty like the Tuileries. Like a dream  
Vienna seems, only not to be of use- impossible.  
In the last extremity, to  
Advance or not to advance, I  
Hear you laughing  
Even still you're calling me  
""not tonight, not tonight  
Not tonight""

So I'll just change direction

And I know what this means

Used to hang and he said  
""It's your choice babe, just remember  
I don't think you'll be back in three days' time so you choose well""

Is it my right to be on my stomack of Fred's Seville  
And do you know Carolina where the biscuits are soft and sweet

And you're pushed flat on your stomach

Easy for some action holy satisfaction ooh  
Midnight makes a call skin begins to crawl  
Inside the heights upon the fantasies  
Let me introduce you now  
I'm gonna let you see the other side of me  
There's a hunger in the night moves me completely  
Hunger in the night bleeds so sweetly  
(it's) a hunger in the night moves me completely  
The hunger in the night bleeds so sweetly  
Through the shadows you won't hear a thing  
Cloaked in darkness my love's a deadly sting  
Watch out

Want to be a hero situation's zero

A lonely man sits cheek to cheek, with unique designs in chrome.  
The mellow years have long gone by, but now he sits alone.  
He has a brand new radio, but never turns it on.  
  
[Chorus]  
New Europeans.  
Young Europeans.  
New Europeans.  
  
A photograph of lovers lost, lies pressed in magazines.  
Her eyes belong to a thousand girls, she's the wife who's never seen.  
Their educated son has left, in search of borrowed dreams.  
His television's in his bed, he's frozen to the screen.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On a crowded beach washed by the sun, he puts his headphones on.  
His modern world revolves around the synthesizer's song.  
Full of future thoughts and thrills, his senses slip away.  
He's a European legacy, a culture for today.

Saw you standin' in the pouring rain  
Left my message on the window pain  
Back on the street again  
Back on the beat again

Saw me climbing to the top of the hill  
You saw me meeting with the fools on the hill  
Learned my lesson and I had my fill  
Learnt it all in vain  
Went through it all again  
Now I'm back on the top again  
  
Always strivin', always climbing way beyond my will  
Same old sensation, isolation at the top of the bill  
Always seeming, like I'm moving but I'm really going slow

Just how I get there will be anybody's guess

Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill  
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun my world has ended my baby's gone  
  
Sometimes I wake up in the night and realize you're gone  
And then I toss upon my bed and wait for day to come  
I try to tell my lonely heart it must go on alone  
But it cries the world has ended my baby's gone  
  
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun my world has ended my baby's gone

I'm a junk bond king  
And I'm on the run  
Me and a friend of mine  
We were headed for the sunshine  
I got my hands on the wheel  
I got gas in the tank  
I got a suitcase full of money  
From a Luxembourg bank  
We didn't stop 'til we got to Big Cypress  
Wandered in to the Legion Hall  
The sign outside said ""Seminole Bingo""  
Fell in love with the ping pong balls  
And the SEC is far behind  
Down in the swamp with the gators and flamingos  
A long way from Liechtenstein  
I'm a junk bond king playing Seminole Bingo  
And my Wall Street wiles  
Don't help me even slightly  
'Cause I never have the numbers  
And I'm losing nightly  
I cashed in the last of my Triple be bonds  
Bought a double-wide on the Tamiami Trail  
I parked it right outside the reservation  
Fifteen minutes from the Collier County Jail  
And the SEC is far behind  
Down in the swamp with the gators and flamingos  
A long way from Liechtenstein  
I'm a junk bond king playing Seminole Bingo

Screaming to be set free  
I would chain you up  
If I'd thought you'd swear  
The only one that mattered was me, me, me  
I would strap you up  
But don't worry baby  
You know I wouldn't hurt you 'less you wanted me to  
It's too late to stop  
Won't the heavens save me?  
My daddy said the devil looks a lot like you  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
Tell me that my soul's forgiven  
Hide you baby's eyes and we can,  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
When the passion dies,  
It's just a matter of time before my heart is  
Looking for a home  
  
I'm like a maniac, at the end of the day  
I'm like a doggie barking at your door  
So come take me back to the place you stay  
And maybe we can do it once more  
  
You say I'm dangerous  
But don't worry baby  
I get excited at the things that you do  
And there's a place for us in a dirty movie  
'cause no-one does it better than me and you  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
Tell me that my soul's forgiven  
Hide your baby's eyes and we can,  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
Please don't tell me lies  
It's just a matter of time before my heart is  
Looking for a home  
  
I ain't got no more worries  
I'm gonna spend some times with you  
Loving you takes such courage  
And don't you think that I know it  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
You tell me that my soul's forgiven  
Hide your baby's eyes and we can,

Don't you tell me lies, because believe me baby  
One day you'll wake up on your own.

My screws kinda loose so I ease to the finish

Blowin' smoke up out the roof from the trees that I'm spliffin'  
Youngin' got the game on lock

Leave you wet like the rain y'all drop

I handle my time and still work it  
Put in work couple mil. worth in  
And I'm from Pittsburgh where the green  
And the eatin' is good  
Where the fiends do everything in the hood  
Everyday is like a war so my soldiers ride fatiguesin the hood  
And we gettin' all the green like we should

Both sides are right but both sides are murdered

Not a south or a central or a native American

Innocent men, innocent women, innocent children  
Thousands of them

Yes,Survival,/y/yes/survival_20148482.html,"Sunshine is creeping in  
And somewhere in a field a life begins  
An egg too proud to rape  
The beginning of a shape of things to come  
That starts the run  
Life has begun  
Fly fast the gun  
  
The mother flew too late  
And life within the egg was left to fate  
Not really knowing how  
The world outside would take it when it came  
And life's the same  
For things we aim  
Are we to blame?  
  
Don't doubt the fact there's life within you  
Yesterday's endings will tomorrow life give you  
All that dies  
Dies for a reason  
To put its strength into the seasons  
  
Survival,  
Survival  
They take away and they give  
The living's right to live (its all that we need to give)  
The living's right to know  
  
The egg breaks all is out  
The crawling bird begins to scream and shout  
Where is the parent bird?  
A loneliness arose and heard its name, ring in  
For lives, begin  
Survival win  
Survival sin  
  
So soon the evening comes  
And with it runs the aching fear of hate  
Could someone still remain  
Who thinks he still could gain by escaping fate?  
It's much too late  
Don't underrate  
Appreciate  
  
Don't doubt the fact there's life within you  
Yesterday's endings will tomorrow life give you  
All that dies  
Dies for a reason  
To put its strength into the seasons

Why he was laughing so when my wife was dead.  
  
He didn't reply,  
No, he didn't reply at all.

And buried in our garden.

Pull up in that Super-coupe, you know them diamonds glistening  
Too much money in the room, guess I hit her in the kitchen then  
Get her to myself man, I ain't hit that girl yet

Every time we got pulled over, never ran her mouth  
Fuck with real niggas, get money baby, off the chain  
Long as baby stay getting money, how can I complain?

Last nigga she was fuckin' with was worth a couple mil

When morality is defeated

Possessed by taking more than we need  
And our motivation's a sad situation

We can learn to leave the past behind  
One day at a time  
We can look the future in the eye  
One day at a time  
We can learn to live  
  
The gates of the garden are open  
Wide and the trusting  
70 thousand will enter  
Of them without reckoning  
  
One day at a time  
We can learn to leave our fears behind  
One day at a time  
We can stare our hopes in the eye  
One day at a time  
We can learn to live  
  
And if you meet the evening  
Don't wait for the sun to rise  
  
One day at a time  
We can leave all treasures behind  
One day at a time  
We can watch the clocks unwind  
  
One day at a time  
A child is born into this world eyes blind  
One day he will find his sign  
And glimpse some other kind of life  
To live by, one day  
  
One day at a time  
We can put machines behind  
One day at a time  
We can learn how birds survive  
One day at a time  
We can learn to fly

Motherfuckers just be hanging around me, because I rap  
It ain't no love involved, no motherfucking love at all  
If I had a price on my head, I bet my partnas would give up they dog  
Wish my mama was living, cause I'd be giving her my time  
Shit, I'd probably never would of started to rhyme  
My lifetime it ain't no sunshine, cause it be raining  
I be trying my best to smile, but I can't cause I be paining  
I'm paranoid all day, I keep my steel with me, bitch ass jackers  
Try to get me, so now my people be scared to come and chill with me  
Fuck y'all, I'm one deep till I D-I-E  
Displaying off some boxing game, when H-O-E's try me  
An S.U.C. Guerilla Maab veteran, constantly head busting  
Leaving em in need, of an exceteran, I'm going  
Do' knocking with a glock, paying a visit to some of my foes and friends  
Z-Ro Jones Jr., swelling em up around the nose and chin

Fuck all of y'all, y'all done pissed a nigga off  
I'm a touch all of y'all, round each and every corner  
Someone follow y'all, they just trying to give you a present  
Something holla dog, and that's for all of y'all  
  
[Z-Ro:]  
I done made up my mind  
I hustle all alone, I'm trying to get a solo shine  
Everytime I turn around, someone bringing me down  
Got tired of em pulling on me, started slanging them rounds  
Now they thinking, I'm a crazy  
Scarred and stabbed and shot, I'm still a baby  
I want my mama, cause I'm having bad dreams and I die in em all  
Got me ain't friendly when you see me, ain't no smiling at all  
Live the thug life, heartless and hopeless  
Laying low ducking the law went North, to Lufkin and Nacogdoches  
I'm connected, my best friend use to be I-10  
Till my out of town connect, pulled out two techs and took my ends  
Got me throwed off in the mind, retaliation's what I taste  
His get blowed off with my nine, incarceration's what I face  
Feel me, I done lost my mind, but I'm not trying to find out where it went to  
It might be for the best, cause I'm not trying to remember the shit I been  
Thru  
  
[Hook x2]  
  
[D-Reck:]  
It's automatic gun fire, till they all expire  
Of course they said they loved me, but they all was lies  
Told me just give em a deal, now I tote a pill  
But when it was forth and ten, only a few was real  
Instead of making you an employee, nigga I made you a friend  
Now look what you lose, your Q's and handle fections stealing your ends  
I've been behind the scenes, but in front of the schemes  
Organized the team, for you to realize your dream  
That's how you pay me back, you funny fake fraud and flipper  
Over pennies and nickels, they turned sour like milk  
It's no wonder why, so many'll never see fortune and fame  
Fuck what you claim motherfucker, you never endue it no pain  
What you bumping for lil daddy, my address the same  
Ain't no pain without no gain, you got the heart to sustain  
Now I'm solo for the do'-low, ain't fucking with you no mo'  
For one thing you do, and I'll have you knocked off for the low-low

I got a sick sense, I got a reason to worry  
And sometimes I'm dense but these thoughts come in a flurry  
You say they're nonsense but I dreamt you left in a hurry

And my breathing's out of whack like a drum machine  
I know if I pass out you'd resuscitate me, right?

Without a Mohawk with a real job and a sweater?

Would you stab me in the back like a homicide  
Or leave me buried in your bullshit like a landslide?

Waiting for someone better to come along?

Are you biding your time with me  
Waiting for someone better to come along?

Cause I have been redeemed and so we're through  
You say, I could have it all  
Trust you, you will never let me fall  
I don't have to give into your demands  
The power's not in your hands

I don't have to do anything you want me to  
I don't need you to make me feel like I want more  
Cause God has shown His love is your weakness  
He is above and beyond all you can do

Adele,Million Years Ago,/a/adele/million+years+ago_21104349.html,"I only wanted to have fun  
Learning to fly learning to run  
I let my heart decide the way  
When I was young  
  
Deep down I must have always known  
That this would be inevitable  
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay  
And bare my soul  
  
I know I'm not the only one  
Who regrets the things they've done  
Sometimes I just feel it's only me  
Who can't stand in reflection that they see  
I wish I could live a little more  
Look up to the sky not just the floor  
I feel like my life is flashing by  
And all I can do is watch and cry  
  
I miss the air  
I miss my friends  
I miss my mother  
I miss it when  
  
Life was a party to be thrown  
But that was a million years ago  
  
When I walk around all of the streets  
Where I grew up and found my feet  
They can't look me in the eye  
It's like they scared of me  
  
I tried to think of things to say  
Like a joke or a memory  
But they don't recognize me now  
In the light of day.  
  
I know I'm not the only one  
Who regrets the things they've done  
Sometimes I just feel it's only me  
Who never became who they thought they'd be  
I wish I could live a little more  
Look up to the sky not just the floor

And all I can do is watch and cry

Don't underestimate the things that I will do

And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
  
Baby I have no story to be told  
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn  
Think of me in the depths of your despair  
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared

Rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside your hand  
But you played it with a beating  
  
Throw your soul through every open door  
Count your blessings to find what you look for  
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold  
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

From the way you talk  
To the way you move  
Everybody here is watching you  
Cause you feel like home  
You're like a dream come true  
But if by chance you're here alone  
Can I have a moment  
Before I go?  
Cause I've been by myself all night long  
Hoping you're someone I used to know

Be exactly like we were before we realised

It was just like a song

Nobody told me that you'd be here  
And I swore you moved overseas  
That's what you said when you left me

Just in case it hasn't gone  
I guess I still care  
Do you still care?

And just like the South, Girl, we're gonna rise again  
Sharing a love that just won't end.

Turned around and walked away  
When I should've held you tight

You just turned out the light

A chance to make it right

Sometimes out of touch

Sometimes giving in  
But never giving up  
We've been worlds apart  
Yet always close enough  
Yeah we've been out of touch  
But never out of love  
  
No matter how we try  
There still may come a time  
When our minds are far apart

Will always find a way  
To be together in our hearts

The road is a lover, you never recover  
Not now or any time soon

When I think where I've been  
Playin' twin to an old fiddle tune, oh  
As the wind chases after the moon  
Through the kindness  
Shown me that day  
I gave him this melody  
And we sang in duet  
'Neath the stars in the sky  
And the shadows of dancing trees

Not now or any time soon  
My head starts to spin  
When I think where I've been  
Playin' twin to an old fiddle tune, oh

The difference is in the way...  
The difference is in the way we are as people  
The difference is the sum of what we are  
So look at the things that join us together  
And take away the things that pull us apart  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
The light that draws us through the tunnel of perception  
Is brighter than the light  
That makes us shield our eyes  
Just believe in the idea and it's purity  
No need to question it's source,  
No need for lies  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
Love of my life, we can change the world...  
We can change...  
Changes...  
The magnetism  
That you feel inside  
Draws you closer  
To the heart of the matter  
And the wisdom  
That you see outside  
Is only a mattter  
Of learning  
And forgetting  
Ooh, we can change the world...  
Love of my life, we can change the world...

Strumming on guitars.  
Men of great renown and faith  
Say prayers on boulevards.

To sing harmony.  
You don't have to be a child  
To love the mystery. (mystery)

On bended knee.  
The heart of this christmas is in you and me.

If your heart's been longing,  
You've been afraid to try,  
Sorrow's kept you company,  
And the dance has passed by,  
I'll lift you up and blaze with you  
Across the moonlit sky  
On the night before christmas.

To sing harmony.  
You don't have to be a child  
To love the mystery. (mystery)

Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to  
Come  
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Where is it written  
What is it I was meant to be?  
That I can't dare  
It all began the day I found  
That from my window I could only see  
A piece of sky  
I stepped outside and looked around  
I never dreamed it was so wide  
Or even half as high  
The time had come  
(Papa, can you hear me?)  
To try my wings  
(Papa, are you near me?)  
And even thought it seemed at any moment I could fall  
I felt the most  
(Papa, can you see me?)  
Amazing things  
(Can you understand me?)  
The things you can't imagine  
If you've never flown at all  
Though it's safer to stay on the ground  
Sometimes where danger lies  
There the sweetest of pleasures are found  
No matter where I go  
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve  
But there will also be  
More to question, yet more to believe  
Oh tell me where?  
Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?  
And want to share  
My every sweet-imagined possibility?  
The more I live - the more I learn  
The more I learn - the more I realize  
The less I know  
Each step I take  
(Papa, I've a voice now!)  
Each page I turn  
(Papa, I've a choice now!)  
Each mile I travel only means  
The more I have to go  
What's wrong with wanting more?  
If you can fly - then soar!  
With all there is - why settle for  
Just a piece of sky?

And watered with all her young tears

In heavenly gardens and bowers

On that tombstone in the shade

How real it all seems.

Every night on my knees I pray:  
Dear Lord, hear my plea.  
Don't ever let another take his love from me  
Or I will surely, surely die.  
  
His love is heavenly.  
When his arms enfold me  
I hear a tender rhapsody.  
But in reality  
He doesn't even know me.  
  
Once again  
Runnin' away with me.

This time you've got nothing to lose  
You can take it, you can leave it  
Whatever you choose  
I won't hold back anything  
And I'll walk away a fool or a king

It's make believe until its only a matter of time  
And some might have learned to adjust

In things refined

From harder times

We drown our doubts  
In dry champagne  
And soothe our souls  
With fine cocaine

And get nowhere  
We'll have to change our jaded ways,

A few more nights on satin sheets  
A few more times that I can say,

Today just never comes  
  
Go on and jump,yeah  
Into the hurricane  
You will forger the pain  
It's only there  
To exorcise your mind  
  
Looking at the world  
When you've open up your eyes  
You've got to see the promises they've made  
They're bloody lies and broken dreams  
Your silence screams  
  
You're living in a time machine  
And you can choose just who you are  
Someone that you've never seen  
Somewhere you've never been  
You're living in a time machine  
  
Oh what are you gonna do  
When every part of you  
Just needs to catch the wind  
  
And the fire of burning yesterdays  
Can only light the way  
To lead you from  
The garden of the dark  
  
Looking for the world  
When you've opened up your eyes  
You'll see you've got invisible chains  
They're only lies  
Not what it seems  
I hear your silent screams  
  
You're living in a time machine  
Nobody cares just where you go  
Taken where you've never been  
Somewhere you don't know  
  
You're living in a time machine  
Why do you stay who you are  
Be what you've never been  
Someone you've never seen  
You're living in a time machine  
Yeah

Promises, made in the night  
  
Call the magic one  
And with the magic comes  
Forever chained to the flame

Too late for tears  
Too late  
And no one hears you  
Do you feel a touch of evil  
(Then) It's too late  
  
To wish and make it so  
To feel the power growing  
Stronger, blessed by the dark

You can say it was a  
Joke you played  
So you must let me go, no  
  
It's too late  
You've said the word  
Too late  
Something heard you  
Too late, now the race is on  
And you're run out of road  
Too late  
For tears  
Too late  
And no one hears you  
Can you feel the touch of evil  
It's too late  
  
Oh oh oh save me  
I believe in your name  
Oh oh I've fallen down  
But now I've found  
Nobody to take the blame  
  
Misery  
It's come to drag me away  
And when the hunter cries  
No alibis  
Get ready for judgment day  
  
As the candle fades  
You can say it was a game you made  
So you must let me go, let me go  
  
It's too late, you've said the word  
Too late, something heard you  
Too late, the spell is gone  
And this time you're the fool  
  
It's too late for tears  
Too late  
And no one hears you  
Welcome to forever  
Welcome it's too late  
Too late

Through a desert of stone,  
And I dreamed of my future wife.  
My sword's in my hand,  
And I'm next in command,  
In this version of Death called Life.  
My plate and my cup,  
Are right straight up,  
I took a rose from the hand of a child.  
When I kiss your lips,  
The honey drips,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
Every day we meet,  
On any old street,  
And you're in your girlish prime.  
The short and the tall,  
Are coming to the ball,  
I go there all the time.  
Behind every tree,  
There's something to see,  
The river is wider than a mile.  
I tried you twice,  
You can't be nice,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
Here come the nurse,  
With money in her purse,  
Here come the ladies and men.  
You push it all in,  
And you've no chance to win,  
You play 'em on down to the end.  
I'm laying in the sand,  
Getting a sunshine tan,  
Moving along, riding in style.  
From my toes to my head,  
You knock me dead,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
I count the years,  
And I shed no tears,  
I'm blinded to what might have been.  
Nature's voice,  
Makes my heart rejoice,  
Play me the wild song of the wind.  
I found hopeless love,  
In the room above,  
When the sun and the weather were riled.  
You're as fine as wine,  
I ain't handing you no line,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
All the merry little elves,  
Can go hang themselves,  
My faith is as cold as can be.  
I'm stacked high to the roof,  
And I'm not without proof,  
If you don't believe me, come see.  
You think I'm blue,  
I think so, too,  
In my words you'll find no guile.  
The game's gotten old,  
The deck's gone cold,  
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.

That man whom with his fingers cheats  
And who lies with ev'ry breath,  
Who passionately hates his life  
And likewise, fears his death.

Whose strength is spent in vain,  
Whose heaven is like Ironsides,  
Whose tears are like rain,  
Who eats but is not satisfied,  
Who hears but does not see,  
Who falls in love with wealth itself  
And turns his back on me.

Who tramples through the mud,  
Who fills his mouth with laughing  
And who builds his town with blood,  
Whose visions in the final end  
Must shatter like the glass.

When his gladness comes to pass.

A good time here doesn't cost much money  
Just a little sweet talking, let the pretties in the party  
And you're set for life  
Or one hell of a night  
  
I can see those sons of beaches  
Out there livin' it up  
In the surf and the sand,  
Man, that life ain't so tough  
So get me in the action  
Let me tell every girl she's the one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade  
(I can almost taste it! )  
  
99, 99, 99  
99 in the shade  
99, 99,  
99 in the, whoa!

There comes a time in someones life  
When you find things that matter  
And every time we touch  
The love runs deep  
We realize it's our to keep  
And that's all that really matters.  
Youll always be my sweet addiction  
In this life my saving grace  
Youre all that really matters  
You know it's true  
Aint no me without you.  
When you're in the dark  
Baby don't despair  
I'm just a spark away  
I will be there  
And that's all that matters.

Yes our flame burns on forever  
And at the final curtain call  
We can say we did it all.

You built a fortress for your hurt to hide

And I still believe we can't be friends  
There's so much more for us to be...

My world was too small for you  
So try your wings the way I used to do

You will fly back home where you belong

So when I miss you like crazy  
I just take a walk to our place down by the sea  
To make a wish on a falling star  
And I wish you were here.... With me  
With me

If you'll only trust in me  
I just want to get down deep inside of you  
So that I can set you free and  
Turn you loose so you can see, so

Fit myself with religion and a story to tell  
First they made me the king then they made me pope  
Then they brought the rope  
  
I woke to a gypsy girl sayin' ""Drink this""  
Well my hands had lost all sensation  
These days I'm feeling all right  
'Cept I can't tell my courage from my desperation  
From the tainted chalice  
Well I drunk some heady wine  
Tonight I'm layin' here  
But there's something in my ear  
Sayin' there's a little town just beneath the floodline  
Needs a local hero  
Somebody with the right style  
Lookin' for a local hero  
Someone with the right smile  
Local hero local hero she said with a smile  
Local hero he used to live here for a while

When she sees you slip up, Ah  
It's like Christmas Eve just to see you trip up  
Ooops, then down again  
She'll sit on the floor hardly hiding a grin  
When her tears spill out, crocodile chagrin  
It's her contempt for you, she thinks you're a slob  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Greatest cook to bring a meal (didn't need a recipe)  
Said she'll also deal the cards (dealt the knave and two and three)  
Said she also feel the thrill of the willow in the wind  
(Feel the thrillo the willow, or oak or elm or ash or pine sol)  
  
It's already too late when she's reading your mail  
Calling your agent and making the deal  
She'll just copy and paste it and make it last  
Nothing is sacred about your past  
  
She'll tell of the poppies in the July fest  
Maybe her brother with the badge can make the arrest  
""You could go to jail, fail all the tests""  
""Forget your keys and your secrets and your little black box""  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She was awfully good at fire (fiery fiery hussy burn)  
She burned bridges where she could (she really couldn't burn them very well)  
She turned young men into torches (burning scarecrow)  
She had a way with wood (do away with wood, do away with wood)  
  
People say a lot when they want the job  
Lining up eager around the block  
Promising, promising never to quit  
Well it's a full time job to be a hypocrite  
Maybe they remember that they've done it before  
Practicing, with their dolls on the floor  
The lie itself becoming the seed  
The messy mascara, the future deed  
The actor's bow, the junkie's need  
They line up again just to wipe you clean  
  
They line up again just to wipe you out  
Line up again around the block  
A mighty force of youth for hire  
Spouting ideas that geniuses would rob oh  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
""Tell me Phoebe, do you want someday to have an award like that of your own?""  
  
""More than anything else in the world""  
  
""Then you must ask Miss Harrington how to get one  
Miss Harrington knows all about it""

You can have your fun

Some big time winners

But now I'm ready  
To quit those sinners  
I've turned myself  
Into the ground  
And now  
I feel so slow  
  
Put a smile on my face  
But don't bloodshot  
My eyes  
The love  
That you give to me  
Has enough surprise  
  
Baby  
You know what I was  
You've seen me  
At parties before  
And don't cha know  
That all  
That running around  
Was wild and gay  
But in the end  
Just a bore  
  
So play  
You can play with me  
But take it easy  
I said take it easy  
Take is easy

I was dying but for you  
It was just another night

You bought me my first shoes  
I was just another lonely child  
Oh and you were much amused  
  
So you took me and you dressed me well  
All for your friends to see  
Drained my body calmly till  
There was no more left in me  
Then you walked out and you cut me cold  
Out on the road somewhere  
Why it happened well I don't know  
And I still have no idea  
  
But everybody needs a friend sometimes  
You need a little help  
And who knows maybe one day you'll seek mine  
Only time will tell  
You once held me in your arms  
You made me feel so right  
I was flying but for you  
It was just another night  
  
But everybody needs a little help  
Whether or not you think you really do  
Everybody needs a little help  
Now the time has come for you  
  
I ain't looking to fight no wars  
No more talking trash  
I'm not seeking any more pain  
Cause I've had enough of that  
But don't you worry it's alright  
If you should come around  
Any night or any day  
I won't ever let you down

To what you've come to know  
When the twilight turns at the end of day  
And the angels kiss the moon  
There's a diamond sun everywhere she goes  
And there ain't no other way  
I'm gonna dream tonight  
By that pale moonlight  
Till the morning comes my way  
  
I'm walking tall  
And I'm walking fine  
And I'm up there  
With that girl of mine  
  
And I'm standing in the twilight now  
Yeah I'm standing by her side  
Oh I'm gazing in that gate of dreams  
Underneath that midnight sky  
Cause there's a diamond sun everywhere she goes  
And there ain't no other way  
I'm gonna dream tonight  
By that pale moonlight  
Till the morning comes my way

I think I saw ol' Santa through my window Christmas eve  
My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe  
It must've been ol' Santa 'cause I saw his big red hat  
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that  
  
And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door  
The same ol' Christmas trick my dad had played since I was four  
He stands outside my bedroom yelling ""Ho! Ho! Ho!"" because  
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus  
  
I think my daddy sees me  
Peeking from my door  
But he pretends he's Santa anyway  
Every year he tries to fool me  
But I'm a big boy now I don't believe in Santa or his sleigh...  
No way!  
  
So I went back to bed and I curled up nice and tight  
I stared out my window and looked into the night  
And then, all of a sudden, through my window I could see  
Santa Claus was flying by and smiling at me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Santa Claus, Santa Claus  
It must've been ol' Santa Claus  
Santa Claus, Santa Claus  
Happy ""Ho! Ho! Ho!"" to you  
  
Then I heard ol' Rudolph tellin' me to come outside  
He told me that ol' Santa wanted me to take a ride  
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh  
Then ol' Santa took me up up and away  
  
We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below  
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show  
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said  
""Little boys like you should be in bed""  
  
So I hollered ""Ho! Ho! Ho!""  
And I put on Santa's hat  
Then he let me hold the reins awhile  
We pulled up to my window  
And I jumped back in my room  
And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile  
  
When I woke up Christmas morning it was clear and bright  
My parents said my window had blown open in the night  
I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat  
And they asked me where I got my big red hat

Christy Moore,Bridget's Pill,/c/christy+moore/bridgets+pill_21007172.html,"Bridget O'Reilly was a fine looking girl  
Well, her skin was like ivory and her teeth shone like  
Pearls  
The fellas all chased her in vain til one day  
She went and got married to Barney O'Shea  
  
They'd been married a year, when to their pride and joy  
Along came a baby, a fine strapping boy  
When three years had past, they'd two boys and a girl  
How to feed them and clothe them made Bridget's head  
Whirl  
  
Bridget went to the priest, she was near desperation  
Because of this process of constant gestation  
O Father, this business is making me I'll  
Would it be a sin if I took to the Pill?  
  
The priest heard her story and when he had heard it  
To higher authorities, perplexed, he referred it  
The bishops were baffled, the cardinals too  
Not one could tell Bridget just what she should do  
  
Two years they debated with holy profundity  
What should be done about Bridget's fecundity  
For now Bridget's children amounted to five  
And she scarcely was able to keep them alive  
  
They gave due attention to points theological  
Points philosophic and physiological  
Til in desperation, the Pope cried, o sod  
There's just one thing to do, I'd best go and ask God  
  
So the Pope sent a letter by five penny post  
On Papal notepaper, addressed, Holy Ghost  
Come send me an answer in double quick time  
  
You can reach me at home, just ring vat 69  
  
The Pope got his answer and then he announced it  
Oral contraception, he thoroughly denounced it  
All chemical means to prevent procreation  
Are banned on the pain or eternal damnation  
  
If we were to allow it, unashamed fornication  
Would spread like a flash to all parts of the nation  
There'd be plagues, fire, and famine and moral  
Pollution  
Atheistical notions and red revolution  
  
And the Lord knows what women would do with their lives  
If they weren't kept so busy as mothers and wives  
They might get ideas not befitting their station  
And wind up in women's or gay liberation  
  
So Bridget, my dear, there's no need for frustration  
Because of the banning of this medication  
The Church, she is merciful, holy, and gracious  
Surely the old rhythm method you'll find efficacious  
  
Away now, said Bridget, I'll have none of your row  
For I tried it before and just look at me now  
Whatever I did, we continued to breed  
And she's off to the chemists with maximum speed  
  
Now the Church is in ferment, in great trepidation  
Lest such thought should spread to the whole  
Congregation  
And they've issued a record to prevent a schism  
By the Pope and the Hierarchy, called, I've got rhythm

Waiting for the evening tide to rise and bring high water.  
Bound for Cuba she must go across the Gulf of  
Mexico and The Caribbean Ocean  
She's carrying a human cargo 83 good companeros  
Each one burning with determination to be free  
  
Chorus  
  
Against Batista, The Fidelistas, courage was their armour As they fought at  
Fidel's side with Che Guevara.  
  
Five days out from Mexico these Companeros  
Landed on the Cuban beach Los Colarados  
Fidel said this year will see our country and our people free Or else we  
Will be martyrs  
We've only guns enough for 20 the enemy has arms a plenty  
Meet him and defeat him and he'll keep us well supplied  
  
Chorus  
  
Five weeks later in the Canyon De La Rio  
Fidels army was reduced to 18 Companeros  
Hungry, weak and unafraid, learning revolutions trade in the high Sierra  
Maestre  
Where the mountain winds did blow bearing seeds to sprout and sow  
New crops in Cuban soil that marked the death of slavery  
  
Chorus  
  
Companeros, tu valaderos (Please correct if wrong - cm)  
Courage was their armour as they fought at Fidel's side with Che Guevara  
  
They made their way across the peak of El Torquino  
Joined by bands of volunteers and the men from Santiago  
They faced Batista's tanks and trains, drove them back across the plains,  
From the high Sierra Maestre  
They drove the gangsters from Los Vios straight across the Cordileros  
Santa Barbra fell to Che Guevara and was free.  
The fire lit on that Cuban beach by Fidel Castro  
Still shines all the way to Terra del Fuego  
Sparks are blown upon the breeze, people rise from off their knees when  
They see the night is burning.  
It blazes up in Venezuela, Bolivia and Guatamala  
Lights the road that we must go in order to be free

I will treat you good  
I know I should  
Something going on around here  
I couldn't crawl back if I tried  
I left my baby by the side of the road  
I left her with a heavy load  
Oh  
Someday

Someday  
I will treat you fine  
Someday  
I will you treat you good

That's alright by me  
You just waiting by the phone  
I should give a little warning  
But I need the things I need  
I'm not proud to need a hand  
But I just don't understand  
So, Why should you come when I call  
  
I never say nothing at all  
Why do I go, when I go  
It's leaving me here all alone  
You ought to get out on your own  
Ain't necessarily a bad thing  
To believe the things I say  
Cause you can make yourself feel good  
You know it's really not a good thing  
  
To give everything to me  
I'm just waiting for the show  
Cause I got no where to go  
So, Why should you come when I call  
I never say nothing at all  
Why do I go, when I go  
It's leaving me here all alone  
You ought to get out on your own  
Cause nothing makes me feel so good  
  
Gets me high  
So I sleep at night  
And that's enough and everything  
  
Alright  
I feel nice  
So sorry in the morning  
Could believe what you believe  
  
I'm used to waking up alone  
And if you think about it  
Anyone you think about is a better love than me  
But if you've not fallin' quite asleep?  
  
I might call tonight  
If that's alright  
Why should you come when I call  
I never say nothing at all  
Why do I go, when I go

It seemed like a good idea way back then.  
But I'm wond'rin' now what daydream took me in.

Like the sighs of a thousand crying souls, crying souls  
There's a time when the traveler is fated to find  
That insight has turned his gaze behind, behind  
And the steps taken yesterday will beckon again  
And lead to his weary journey's end, his journey's end  
And in the passage from the cradle to the grave we are born, madly dancing  
Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
I cast my fate with the wife of Lot I turned my gaze around  
Knowing neither what I sought nor what was to be found  
Heeding weakness, feeding strength, oh life at length is frail  
I seek again the river's source through time's dark shadowed veil  
In the fast fading century, as we spin through the years  
I pray that our failing vision clears, our vision clears  
And in the passage from the cradle to the grave we are born, madly dancing  
Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
The places dash and the faces dart like fishes in a dream  
Hiding 'neath the murky banks of long forgotten streams  
The lines of life are never long when seen from end to end

Def Leppard,Too Late For Love,/d/def+leppard/too+late+for+love_20038941.html,"Somewhere in the distance I hear the bells ring  
Darkness settles on the town as the children start to sing  
And the lady 'cross the street she shuts out the night  
There's a cast of thousands waiting  
As she turns out the light  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
  
London boys are gazing as the girls go hand in hand  
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand  
And the queen of the dream stands before them all  
She stretches out her hand as the curtains start to fall  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand  
And the queen of the dream stands before them all  
She stretches out her hand as the curtain starts to fall  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
  
Standing by the trapdoor aware of me and you  
Are the actor and the clown they're waiting for their cue  
And there's a lady over there she's acting pretty cool  
But when it comes to playing life  
She always plays the fool  
  
But it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
It's too late, it's too late, too late  
Too late for love  
  
Is it all too late  
Much too late  
Can't you see it's all too late  
It's too late  
  
But it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
It's too late, it's too late, too late

Wallowing in dirt  
Crying out with hunger

Soap won't wash away your shame

That something isn't right  
Seeing your brother's fists  
Clenched ready for the fight  
Soon the fighting turns to weapons  
And the weapons turn to wounds  
So the doctors stitch and stitch  
And stitch and stitch and stitch  
And stitch and stitch  
  
Surgery won't improve your pain

It makes me want to give up  
But why should I give up  
When it all seems so stupid

That something can be done  
To eradicate these problems  
And make the people one

Stitch and stitch and stitch

And he takes you out in vaudeville valley  
With his hand up smothering your screams

For the first time in I don't know when  
We were so close once upon a time  
There were five of us kids at home  
Two girls, three boys and Dad and Mom  
But that was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
Remember that old swimming hole  
Where we would swim so long ago  
And all them possum grapes and muskedines  
And do you recall the time  
We all got drunk on homemade wine  
That was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Life was simple for us then  
If only it could be again  
How I wish we could go back in time  
But time moves on and nothin' lasts  
Except the memories from the past  
Memories from the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Remember how we talked as kids  
Of what we'd be when we got big  
And all the dreams that we held in our minds  
I wanted to be a singin' star  
And you all said that I'd go far  
But that was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Remember all the fun we had  
Back when they say times were bad  
And life was good to us and things were fine  
We had fun and we had love  
And a mom and dad to care for us  
But that was is the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Life was simple for us then  
If only it could be again  
How I wish we could go back in time  
But time moves on and nothin' lasts  
Except the memories from the past  
Memories from the better part  
Of life we left behind  
Sweet memories from the better part

Dolly Parton,Blue Valley Songbird,/d/dolly+parton/blue+valley+songbird_20041673.html,"She was born in a place called Blue Valley  
At the foot of the Tennessee hills  
With the blue birds and blue bells  
And blue mountain water  
And the sound of the Blue Whippoorwill  
But there was no peace in the valley  
Her daddy, a cruel, ruthless man  
Used and abused her mind and her body  
So her mama said run while you can  
So at fifteen she took to the highway  
Belongings and guitar in hand  
And she buried herself in her music  
The one thing she did understand  
  
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet  
Her voice has that high, lonesome sound  
She hurts, and her songs are the best way to show it  
So the Blue Valley songbird keeps traveling around  
  
She hopes someday she will make it  
And everyone says that she will  
When she comes to town, crowds flock around  
To see the girl from the Tennessee hills  
She writes her letter back home to her mama  
In care of the preacher in town  
They're sacred to her so she reads them at church  
And so her daddy cannot track her down  
  
And she sings like a bird and she cries like a baby  
Whenever she turns off the lights  
She's a whole lot lonesome and a little bit crazy  
From mem'ries and miseries and dreams gone awry  
  
Blue dress, blue shoes, a blue Cadillac  
A band dressed in blue by her side  
Instruments tied to the top and the back  
'Cause the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight  
  
One nighters, honky tonks, years flying by  
She never made it, but Lord knows she tries  
Expressing the feelings she holds inside  
And the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight  
Oh the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight  
  
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet

Should be keepin' us apart

When the problems of this life  
Had not yet crossed my mind  
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes  
I'd come runnin' back to you  
I'd come runnin' back to you  
  
But you know we can't  
Live on dreams alone  
Got to pay the rent  
So I must leave you all alone

And now this travelin' life

It's like a dagger through the heart  
Do you think that my feelings don't matter,  
Or your cheatin' or hurtful remarks  
When you leave me all broken and shattered  
It's like a dagger through the heart

When you've made hurtin' me such an art,  
Tossed around like a used box of crayons,

I heard somebody yelling, it sounded like a fight.  
It was just a drunken hobo dancing circles in the night,  
Pouring whiskey on the headstones in the blue moonlight.  
So often have I wondered where these homeless brothers go,  
Down in some hidden valley were their sorrows cannot show,  
Where the police cannot find them, where the wanted men can go.  
There's freedom when your walking, even though you're walking slow.  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,  
That homeless brother is my friend.  
  
It's hard to be a pack rat, it's hard to be a 'bo,  
But living's so much harder where the heartless people go.  
Somewhere the dogs are barking and the children seem to know  
That Jesus on the highway was a lost hobo.  
And they hear the holy silence of the temples in the hill,  
And they see the ragged tatters as another kind of thrill.  
And they envy him the sunshine and they pity him the chill,  
And they're sad to do their living for some other kind of thrill.  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,  
That homeless brother is my friend.  
  
Somewhere there was a woman, somewhere there was a child,  
Somewhere there was a cottage where the marigolds grew wild.  
But some where's just like nowhere when you leave it for a while,  
You'll find the broken-hearted when you're travelling jungle-style.  
Down the bowels of a broken land where numbers live like men,  
Where those who keep their senses have them taken back again,  
Where the night stick cracks with crazy rage, where madmen don't  
Pretend,  
Where wealth has no beginning and poverty no end.

A man he stares into a TV screen  
From the next apartment we hear music  
Bleeding through the scene  
  
TV pans the bedroom, woman's sleeping  
Hands are sprawled out loosely across the bed  
She must be pretty rich  
'Cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck  
  
[Chorus]  
And there's always someone watching  
Eyes  
TV's and someone's watching  
Eyes  
In the kitchen someone's watching  
Eyes  
And the maid and butler's watching  
Eyes  
  
Silent sunbeams falling across the window  
Suddenly she awakens with surprise  
Day and night they always go so quickly  
In TV time...  
  
Her husband rushes in and in the meantime  
She just slightly smiles and turns her head  
He just whispers something to her softly  
God knows what he said...  
  
You know it wasn't very long  
Before the two of them were kissing  
She was his wife, he was her man  
But they knew what they were missing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
TV's on and someone's watching  
Eyes  
They're getting in through your eyes  
Don't let them poison your mind...

And I'm takin' it all the way.  
Takin' all these blues to the highway  
Tryin' to get her out of my mind.  
When I'm out on the open road

I'll leave my heartache behind.  
Raindrops on my window,  
Teardrops from my eyes,

Now I know that's just a lie.  
So I pack my suitcase  
And head out that old front door.  
Better take a long last look now baby

Well, we're going out fishing  
For herring fish that live in the

Herring fish that lived  
In the beautiful sea  
Now cast your nets wherever  
You wish never afeared are we

Fisherman three:  
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

Threw to the stars and  
The twinkling foam  
Then down from the skies came  
The wooden shoe bringing  
The fisherman home  
  
Twas all so pretty a sight  
It seemed as if it could not be  
And some folks thought it was  
A dream they dreamed  
Of sailingthe beautiful sea

Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.  
  
Me and my -ah- mother and father - and a  
Grandmother and a grandfather - were driving through  
The desert, at dawn, and a truck load of Indian  
Workers had either hit another car, or just - I don't  
Know what happened - but there were Indians scattered  
All over the highway, bleeding to death.  
  
So the car pulls up and stops. That was the first time I tasted fear.  
I musta' been about four - like a child is like a flower,  
His head is just floating in the breeze, man.  
The reaction I get now thinking about it, looking back  
Is that the souls of the ghosts of those dead Indians  
Maybe one or two of 'em, were just running around freaking out,  
And just leaped into my soul.  
And they're still in there.  
  
Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding  
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.  
  
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven  
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice  
Blood in my love in the terrible summer  
Bloody red sun of fantastic L.A.  
  
Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers  
Blood will be born in the birth if a nation  
Blood is the rose of mysterious union  
Blood on the rise, it's following me.  
  
Indian, Indian what did you die for?  
Indian says, nothing at all.

That's the wrong thing to do  
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you  
That's the wrong thing to do  
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying  
And say I love you too  
  
But I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
Something's been missing  
You know it, oh ho, she knows it  
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it  
I need someone different (oh ho, oh ho)  
  
We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together  
But we sure make it feel like we're together  
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it  
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it  
I need someone different  
You know it, oh ho, you know it

Tonight, right now? 'Did I go out' yeah I went out, I went, I went to a couple

You should see someone about a cold drink, I don't know, I'm delirious' night'  
  
Cups of the Rose  
Bitches in my old phone  
I should call one and go home  
I've been in this club too long  
The woman that I would try  
Is happy wit a good guy  
But I've been drinking so much  
That I'ma call her anyway and say  
  
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad  
I know you still think about the times we had  
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found  
And since you picked up I know he's not around  
  
(Are you drunk right now?)  
  
I'm just sayin', you could do better  
Tell me have you heard that lately?  
I'm just sayin' you could do better  
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me  
  
Uh, cups of the XO  
All my people been here  
I see all of her friends here  
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more  
Flights in the morning

And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches

I don't think I'm conscious of making monsters  
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad  
But shit it's all good  
We threw a party, yeah we threw a party  
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party  
I was just calling cause they were just leaving  
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in  
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?  
Too many drinks have been given to me  
I got some women that's living off me  
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed  
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names  
After a while girl they all seem the same  
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain  
Having a hard time adjusting to fame  
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl  
I'm lucky that you picked up  
Lucky that you stayed on  
I need someone to put this weight on  
  
""Well I'm sorry""  
""Are you drunk right now?""  
  
I'm just sayin', you could do better  
Tell me have you heard that lately  
I'm just sayin' you could do better

""You're not going to come?""  
""Guess I'm bout to just kick it here then""  
  
Just throw up while I hold your hair back  
Her white friend said ""you niggas crazy""  
I hope no-one heard that  
I hope no-one heard that  
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble

Switchin' up the angles

Four or five chains made of gold getting tangled  
My nigga Biz said ""the first mil gonna change you""  
Change for the better, hit it then dead her  
Thats my vendetta, keep this shit together

Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass  
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life  
Now I'm in the east cause my boys are gettin' right  
Man, I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year  
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear

They're expecting her and she's got work to do

It's meaningless to try  
As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes  
He says, I've never seen her get this bad  
  
Even though she seems so high  
He knows that she can't fly  
And when she falls out of the sky  
He'll be standing by  
  
She was raised in a small Midwestern town  
By a charming and eccentric loving father  
She was praised as the perfect teenage girl  
And everyone thought highly of her  
  
And she tried everyday  
With endless drive to make the grade  
Then one day she woke up to find  
The perfect girl had lost her mind  
  
Once barely taking a break, now she sleeps the days away  
She helplessly stands by, it's meaningless to try  
And all she wants to do is cry  
No one ever knew she was so sad  
  
'Cause even though she gets so high  
And thinks that she can fly, she will fall out of the sky  
But in the face of misery, she found hopefulness  
Feeling better, she had weathered this depression  
  
Much to her advantage  
She resumed her frantic pace  
Boundless power, midnight hour  
She enjoyed the race

Lying on the ground  
  
Standing by her was a man  
Nervous, shaking, gun in hand  
Witness says he tried to help  
But he'd turned the weapon on himself

She may have found a reason to forgive  
If he had only tried to change  
Was their fatal meeting prearranged  
  
Had a violent struggle taken place  
There was every sign that lead there  
Witness found a switchblade on the ground  
Was the victim unaware

They found a note in the killer's pocket

Just one smile to make my life worth living

All the things I want to say  
If some way, you could see what's in my heart  
Oh, baby  
  
I don't ask for much  
A look, a smile, a touch  
Try to forget  
Lord knows, I'm trying  
It's so hard to forget  
When your whole world you know is dying

Fighting with automatic self destruction

It's a blind faith  
A cruel waste  
One bitter taste  
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation  
  
Listen music that we play, somehow gets glued to your brain  
I'm the future when I'm in the boost I'm like I'm living in 3008  
This music gave me a lane to ride in,  
But there aint' cars in the sky yet, so hold tight  
Because I'm in flight like a plane with a of a lion  
You know why? Because I got pole bars hard like crowbars  
You can't gamble with no cards  
What d'you wanna call it then you get stung like a phone charge  
Music mentally uses me like a sailor might use sonar  
To find where the flows are, upon an ocean floor that's so dark  
  
Sweet sensation  
The music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
Sweet sensation  
Listen, listen, the music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
  
My heart falls heavy, like a bankers belly  
But when I'm writing songs,  
I'm happy like chunk when you got away from the Portellies  
And there's a musical vibe that usually moves inside of my mind  
Therefore I've got a fortune already, and I ain't even talking in pennies  
So ride on, my faith is blind like a man who requires a guide dog  
And life's wrong, but I stride on regardless of anything I am strong  
I got all that I need in a mic and a beat to see how alive I can be  
  
And I got sweet sensation inside of me, because my mind's ease  
  
I am a man with a heavy heart,  
And I dare not tear the pages  
Fighting with automatic self destruction  
I...  
It's a blind faith  
A cruel waste  
One bitter taste  
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation  
  
Listen, I wanna say rest in peace, for children murdered on you. K. Streets  
When a country wages a war there's a war going on in our very own streets  
And I say that life's too short, to end up in the move of a cool  
So why not give music a fall and use it to dive like a hawk  
Listen, we all get down in the dumps  
But when they hear the melody and base line pump  
I feel my heart rate jump through the roof and then  
I run loose on my tongue  
Confer with Morpheus if you need proof I'm the one  
Or I'll put my heart on the scales to prove that my  
Cardiac muscle weighs more than a ton  
  
Sweet sensation  
The music that we play  
Will ease your mind

A youth asleep in the foreign soil, planted by the war  
Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth  
See the stems of Europe bend under force  
  
All quiet

All quiet on the Western Front  
  
So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares  
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir  
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand  
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands  
  
It's gone all quiet on the Western Front, male angels sigh  
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies  
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys  
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise

It's sure enough the favored nations aided their decline

Or was I just some nightclub singer, back in nineteen sixty three  
In the old part of Valencia, on the coast of Spain  
Never tiring once of hearing songs about going home again  
  
If I could go back home, if I could go back home

Way behind the water hole  
A little down the line  
The jungle and the plains and peaks  
Are scheduled to be mine  
  
Im gonna be the ruler  
Of most everything around  
From the grandest of the mountains  
To the humble common ground  
My reign will be a super awesome thing  
Oh, I just can't wait to be king  
  
Im gonna be a noble king  
Unscrupulously fair  
I only need a little time  
Perhaps a little hair  
  
Im gonna be the mane event  
Like no king was before  
Im brushing up on looking down  
Im working on my roar  
The fauna and the flora gonna swing  
Oh, I just can't wait to be king  
  
No one saying do this  
No one saying be there  
No one saying stop that  
No one saying see here  
Free to run around all day  
Ill be free to do it my way  
  
The time has come as someone said  
To talk of many things  
This may be true  
But I would rather stick to talking kings  
  
Its easy to be royal if you're already leonine  
It isn't just my right even my left will be divine  
The monarchy is waiting to go zing  
Oh I just can't wait to be king

To the very bottom  
Because they made him and they'll waste him  
And I don't believe that I want to watch them  
  
'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear  
He was an idol then, now he's an idol here  
But his face has changed, he's not the same no more  
And I have to say that I like the way his music sounded before  
  
He was tight-assed  
Walking on broken glass  
Highly prized in the wallet size  
The number one crush in a schoolgirl's eyes  
But don't pretend that it won't end  
In the depth of your despair  
You went from lame suits right down to tennis shoes  
To peanuts from the lion's share

Now I got him past that redhead in atlanta  
Lord I walked all over that black-eyed cajun queen  
But outside of amarillo, he found his thrill, I'll tell you  
Oh, I lost him to a jukebox and a pinball machine  
  
Oh amarillo what'd you want my baby for  
Oh amarillo now he won't come home no more  
You done played a trick on me  
Hooked him in the first degree  
While he put another quarter  
Push dolly and then porter  
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machine  
  
If we only hadn't stopped in there for coffee  
If someone hadn't played the window up above  
He'd still be mine today  
But he heard those fiddles play  
One look and then I knew this must be love  
Oh that pinball machine was in the corner  
Well he saw the lights and he had to hear 'em ring  
And he never was the same after he won his first free game  
Oh I lost him to a jukebox and a pinball machine

I could never be gold.

Of all you needed me to be  
Though I came with sweet intentions,  
More my pockets could not hold

The ways you said I let you down  
When I fell into that river of no return,  
And you watched me drown  
Oh I could sparkle like a diamond,  
Have silver line my soul

You looked so high and low for heaven,  
I tried so hard to show the way  
But though I flew on wings of angels,  
My feet were always made of clay  
I could come trailing clouds of glory,  
But you saw nothing to behold

I'm in the gallardo, laughing like Ricky Ricardo (Ha ha ha ha)

Just spray, and shit'll get you ten minute of shine  
Keep a friend in it, that's ten cented for mine  
Keep the rims in it, that spin in it for mine  
Can't see him in it, I been tinted up mine

When the last decrepit factory has dumped its final load of toxic waste into
the water supply and shipped its last badly manufactured, incompetently
designed consumer thing, we gaze in astonishment as the denizens of NU-PERFECT
AMERICA, dine on rats (mmmmm), poodles, Styrofoam packing pellets, all
floating in a broth of tritium-enriched sewage, roasting the least diseased
body parts of abandoned wild children accumulating since the total ban on
abortion a few years back.

Young woman confused  
Young woman abused  
You must understand  
It's never too late to, lose who you are  
And choose who you are supposed to be  
Supposed to become  
You've been in and out  
Up and down, back and forth  
Backwards around  
Not a friend, not a mother, not a father  
Just God and you should make a choice  
What you ought to do  
What matters most  
Who you are to you  
Opinions of the old and young  
Shouldn't matter to you  
Take advice think it over twice  
Make a choice that helps you sleep at night  
It's decent, but recently  
Things have shown us  
We have done the wrong things often  
Never suicide, that's the easy route  
There's always another way out  
Think about it (think about it)  
  
Chorus (2x)  
You can give up  
Or you can get up  
Just don't let what you need pass by  
Spread your wings to the sky  
Let you soul fall in love  
  
You can fly  
  
Verse 2:  
Now see if you went through life with your eyes closed  
You never would'a known there was a high road  
  
Let people get the best of you and get mad at them  
Instead of bein' mad at yourself  
You're only number one in your life  
And you will decide if it goes right  
Every time you digress  
Defeat your progress  
Feed you knowledge, but you must digest  
The controversy yo can get personal  
They don't understand till the role reversal  
Seekin' fame, play their games  
Gave a whole lot for a whole little gain  
Push comes to shove  
Do you push or shove?  
When the choice is yours  
Do you leave or you love?  
All the tears you cried, you're dyin' inside  
When will you decide to survive  
  
Chorus (2x)  
You can give up  
Or you can get up  
Just don't let what you need pass by  
Spread your wings to the sky  
Let your soul fall in love

Fly

They could give us a war  
Just to keep us amused  
  
We are so fragile  
I could stay here inside  
And say 'It's all been done'  
We are so fragile  
Just pretend I never tried  
I'll leave up to you  
  
We are still so young  
And it must be wrong  
But I'll do it all the same  
We are really so shy  
There's nothing I can do  
Except believe in you  
  
We could always go home  
But everyone says  
This is the place to be  
We are so unnatural  
But you wouldn't understand  
You only deal with men

Isn't she lovely, isn't she wonderful?  
Isn't she precious, less than one minute old,  
I never thought through love you'll be  
Making love as lovely as she.  
Isn't she lovely, and she's made it from love.  
Isn't she pretty she's so pretty, truly the angel best,  
For I am so happy I'm so happy, we have been heaven blest,  
I can't believe what God has done,  
To you, He has given life to one,  
Isn't she lovely, and she's made it from love.  
Isn't she lovely she's so lovely, life and love are the same.  
Life is Aida Aida, the meaning of her name.  
Candies good have not been done.  
Without you she'll be the one.  
Oh so very lovely, isn't she pretty? Isn't she pretty?  
Isn't she lovely, yes, she is made from love.

I will be your father

Don't cry  
This is not the end, nor goodbye  
But begin  
To know I'm with you 'til the end  
And when you pray  
I will hear every word you say  
And so with all my promises made  
For one like you  
Someone who's especially made

Knowing full well  
That I'd be the first one  
To go down.

Except when things weren't going your way  
And then the lady would say that she'd had enough  
Wandering around on her own.  
  
The day you left  
Well I think you knew you'd not be back  
Well at least it would seem that way  
Because you never said goodbye.  
But when it comes round to you and me  
I'm sure it will work out alright.  
  
And you'd be the one who was laughing  
And giving me something I don't need  
And you know, I'd always hold you and keep you warm  
Oh! more fool me.

Round to you and me  
I ask myself  
Do I really believe  
In your love.

For an hour her face looks strange

Marching to the promised land  
Where the honey flows and takes you by the hand  
Pulls you down on your knees  
While you're down a pool appears  
The face in the water looks up  
And she shakes her head as if to say  
That it's the last time you'll look like today  
  
Sail away, away

Gone to the other side  
Sail away, sail away  
  
The face that launched a thousand ships  
Is sinking fast, that happens you know  
The water gets below  
Seems not very long ago  
Lovelier she was than any that I know  
  
Angels never know it's time  
To close the book and gracefully decline  
The song has found a tale  
My, what a jealous pool she is  
The face in the water looks up  
She shakes her head as if to say  
That the blue girls have all gone away  
  
Sail away, away

Dive to the bottom and go to the top  
To see where they have gone  
Oh, they've gone to the other side

See the lord and all the mouths he feeds

Through ye woode, here may ye rest awhile

I guess the world was getting warmer

My mother had a brother  
Same desire, different time  
Seems the empty spaces tortured him  
Until he took his own life  
  
I don't know why I waited so long for love  
I just don't know what I was thinking of  
All that wasted time  
  
But mama will you tell him from your boy  
The times they changed

While we got stronger  
Mother will you tell him about my joy  
I live each day with him  
Your son came out, yeah,  
And I'm still breathing it in  
  
And I swear now that freedom is here  
I'm gonna taste it all for you boy  
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little torn  
I'm making so much love  
  
So those of us who have nothing to fear  
We've got to make damn sure that it was worth it  
I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little stoned  
I'm making so much love  
  
I was a prisoner, but he saved me  
Broke into my dreams and said, ""Who cares?""  
I was a prisoner, so disgrace me  
I'm glad to be home  
And I don't believe they care.

George Michael,Round Here,/g/george+michael/round+here_10130015.html,"My daddy got here on the gravy train  
I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game  
They went walking and she took his name  
Round here  
  
There was dancing in the afternoons those days  
Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made  
It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same  
  
Frightened little girl, she makes a break  
Into the arms of, something better  
Round here

Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark  
Waiting patiently to make my mark  
Round here

And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool  
I remember it all, like yesterday  
  
Don't you  
  
Every time I try to leave this place  
Something inside says, ""You can do better""  
Round here  
  
So come with me, let me show you where I've lived  
I want to put my hands in this earth again  
Music fell like rain to the streets  
The Specials and The Jam, to The Beat  
Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world  
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space  
Is the place of my birth  
  
When all that I wanted, was to be someone.  
  
Two little Hitlers in an old church hall  
Some cheesy covers and those neighbors that banged on the walls  
Andy says it's time to show them all  
Round here  
  
Please sir, we two have other plans  
Please sir you would not understand,  
What's going on  
Is magical, can't you see  
That some of us do more than dream

In this town,  
Yes I guess I got to be someone  
  
To be somebody

It's everything I know (everything and everybody)  
On the streets of London

Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colors  
And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone  
He's gone  
When the wars of our nation did beckon  
A man barely twenty did answer the calling  
Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation  
He's gone  
But eternity knows him, and it knows what we've done  
And the rain fell like pearls on the leaves of the flowers  
Leaving brown, muddy clay where the earth had been dry  
And deep in the trench he waited for hours  
As he held to his rifle and prayed not to die  
But the silence of night was shattered by fire  
As guns and grenades blasted sharp through the air  
And one after another his comrades were slaughtered  
In morgue of Marines, alone standing there  
He crouched ever lower, ever lower with fear  
""They can't let me die! The can't let me die here!  
I'll cover myself with the mud and the earth  
I'll cover myself! I know I'm not brave!  
The earth! the earth! the earth is my grave""

We can sit and talk for hours  
We'll just have fun  
You can tell me what you did  
Christmas morning as a kid  
And we'll talk about all our Christmases to come  
  
And if I hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway  
I'm sure to get a kiss  
And is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow  
To complete this singular wish  
It shines, it's new  
I know what I want and nothin' else will do

And one lover parts in pain

I feel this urge to run  
Repairing hearts so easily shattered  
Is never any fun

You see me looking at you

Shielding my eyes from the pitiless light of the glare

But you think I should be happy  
With your money and your name  
Sit alone and hide my sorrows  
While you play your cheatin' game  
  
Silver threads and golden needles  
Cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I dare drown my sorrow  
In the warm glow of your mind  
  
You can't buy my love with money  
'Cause I ain't never been that kind  
Silver threads and golden needles  
Cannot mend this heart of mine

With his underwear stuffed and his trapdoor undone.

Look at your game, girl  
Look at your game, girl  
  
What a mad delusion  
Living in that confusion  
Frustration and doubt  
Can you ever live without the game?  
  
The sad, sad game  
Mad game  
Just to say loves' not enough  
Even it can't be true  
Oh, you can tell those lies, baby, but you're only fooling you  
  
Can you feel?  
Are those feelings real?  
Look at your game, girl  
Go on look at your game, girl  
  
And if you can't feel  
And those feelings aint real  
Then you better, stop tryin'  
Or your gonna play cryin'  
Stop tryin'  
Or your gonna play cryin'  
Stop tryin'  
  
That's the game  
Sad sad game  
Mad game

Sun goes down, I'm all dressed up,

Walkin' up and down the street,  
I knock on the door and say...

Well howdy boys, howdy, man, man it sure seems like a long time  
Since I last rode down this old trail. How ya all anyhow?  
Fellas, you see, I still have this old cigar box with me. Yes Sir!  
And better yet, all the boys out here at the R.K. Ranch are singin'  
A new song now. Hope you like it because it's my answer to  
The Blue Velvet Band. It goes like this.  
By and old willow tree in the churchyard  
On the banks of the old Rio Grande  
Lies a loved one who died broken hearted  
She was known as the Blue Velvet Band  
She was called by the angels up yonder  
As the dew kissed the pale summer rose  
As we stood there in silence, dishearted  
These words to her lover did go  
Dear Jack, you mistrusted your darling  
You said that my love wasn't true  
You've roamed o'er the wide open spaces  
But my thoughts, they were always of you  
Now, my last wish was once more to see you  
But they say you're in some foreign land  
You're forgiveness is in this last message  
From your heartbroken Blue Velvet Band  
Far away o'er the lone western prairie  
Her message sped fast o'er the way  
To the side of a bed where her cowboy  
Was grieving his life fast away  
Please grant a last wish, boys, and lay me  
Out West on that old Rio Grande  
Neath that old willow tree in the churchyard  
By my sweetheart, the Blue Velvet Band

To sail my ship of love along the moonlit bay  
And anchor in the harbor of your heart  
The Trade Winds there on Bluebird Island  
Soon dried her lonely tears away

""You'll find upon that ring sweetheart my name engraved in gold

But long he stayed and while he strayed the maiden's love grew cold.  
  
Three years had passed, he did not some, and Nell will wed tonight

Just then there stood within the door a figure tall and slim  
A handsome cowboy was their guest and slowly he walked in  
""I'll drink with you a toast."" said he, and quickly in her glass  
He dropped his half of wedding ring, then anxiously he watched.  
  
She tipped her glass and from her lips a ring fell shining bright  
The token she had longed to see lay there beneath the light  
""Though years have been between us dear, love won our last long fight,

The angel that opened the records,

... Out of place  
  
Honestly now...  
If fate were to follow fortune  
And clarity trail distortion  
Sister on alert  
Pay close attention  
To fingerprints in the dust  
And fallen feet that leave no trace  
Safety's just danger  
... Out of place  
  
Sincerely now...  
I requested information  
At a roadside station  
Sister it seems absurd  
To be hammering pith  
Like a poet with a loss for words  
Trying to describe an angel's face  
Safety's just danger  
... Out of place  
  
Honestly now...  
Wholly in demand  
Coming off second hand  
Sister don't unravel  
When there's nowhere to go  
Except lawless travel  
And an end to infinity's space  
Safety's just danger  
... Out of place

And if you say that I'm simple, you're on the ball  
On the ball to say that I'm going nowhere  
But I'm going nowhere with love  
  
They all say that I'm not impressive at best  
That's O. K., I've got nobody to impress  
My impression is they'd rather be elsewhere  
Oh, I'm staying nowhere with love  
  
Well, it's better to be happy in a cardboard shack  
Than to be alone in a castle  
All you get for your money is a heart attack  
I'd just as soon alleviate the hassle  
  
Every day, I watch the go-getters go by  
Even they say the ladder is much too high  
Why should I go high, I'm happy below there  
Right here in nowhere with love

Put away the wine

No reward for the find

Only 'cause I don't have you  
  
Don't bother with ovations  
Leave off the fanfare  
Let the candles melt down  
Till the smoke's all that's there  
Leave the veil in place  
A tear, la mer  
I could say it was nothing  
Now that there's nothing new  
Only 'cause I don't have you  
  
Not built on a wisp or whim  
Twist an arm, break a leg  
Tear me limb from limb  
If there's a point you've made it  
If there's a fare I've paid it  
  
Later on good wishes  
Later on good try  
I'm afraid won't do

You go from the privy  
And you end up deprived  
On top of the world

Only 'cause I don't have you

Fall like fire, soak like rain,  
Flow like mighty waters, again and again.  
Sweep away the darkness, burn away the chaff,  
And let a flame burn to glorify Your name.  
  
I will never be the same again,  
I can never return, I've closed the door.  
I will walk the path, I will run the race  
And I will never be the same again.  
And I will never be the same again.  
And I will never be the same again.

Under the crimson wings of hate where the lost are safe  
Until they love again

The questions are answered and we try not to weep  
Until we are sure we're suffering for love  
In the dungeon of our dreams we're so weak  
The promise made to be broken still haunts our sleep  
We won't open our eyes afraid we would die for love again  
  
The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there  
And that hope will be our love's requiem  
The salvation we seek will be waiting us there  
In the heart of darkness lonely and scared  
With a promise of death for our love  
And now that we're free from the chains of our dark love  
I'm lost  
And now that we're free from the chains of our dark love

But it's true our journey  
Turned into quite a commotion.  
  
People report that we sported these hats  
But that's not true, I mean, would you?  
Anyway the main thing to say  
We began the usa  
Our little band of religion fans  
From the East Midlands.  
  
We all believed slowly  
That England was becoming less holy  
So set off for Holland  
Cause there we had friends  
But in the end seemed the Netherlands  
Would never be the land, we planned.  
  
Couldn't stand to remain on that terrain  
So again we rearranged  
To start a new nation with our congregation  
A new and calmer life took a farmer and a builder and his wife  
And a clerica, to find America.  
  
Oh it's a new world  
It wasn't new to the natives  
Still we thought we'd claim it  
Yeah, it's the new world.  
  
I still remember 9th of November  
The year 1620 and we saw plenty of land  
We thanked God when we found ground  
I kept calm but it didn't go as planned.  
  
Couldn't land on the sand  
A month later though, we made it  
New Plymouth man, we claimed it  
The natives said not  
But ran when we shot.  
  
Moved there it proved yeah  
That life would be tough  
Cause we didn't have enough  
Of the right stuff.  
Did you know had no seeds we could grow  
Although William Mullins had stacked  
126 pairs of shoes in his pack  
Now that's whack.  
  
A fishing rod, a plough,  
A pig, or a cow  
Would have been a much better idea  
But now there's no food for us to eat  
Does this mean that we'll meet with de feet!  
  
No fun in the new world  
I'm glad we've arrived here  
But will we survive here  
Yeah, in the new world.  
  
People were staving  
Our numbers halving  
And when the winter winds blew  
Even fewer live through  
It wasn't pretty in our new city  
But the natives took pity even though  
They didn't have to.  
  
Man called Squanto  
Showed us how to grow maize  
Catch eel for a meal  
Build shelter in the baze  
Tribe gave us a feast  
Our starvation ceased  
What they had done  
Turned us back from the dead  
To the living and to this day  
That's why we have thanks-giving.  
  
In Massachusetts built a colony it's true

'cause I've found there's nothing more  
That I could say to you  
Nothing I could do to change your mind  
Change your ways and your tune  
So please don't feel you have to sway  
Or move away from how you feel  
And please say what you mean to say  
And always stay with a heart of steel

This desire  
Is not ordinary  
Love is screaming at you  
  
If the moon should turn red over your head don't let her go  
Just believe it's your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find  
  
You find a love like this once in your life  
A diamond in your hand not a piece of glass  
Picture you  
Looking back on what you've  
Done to lose all this time  
  
If the moon should turn red over your head don't let her go  
If the sea should turn dry don't let him fly don't say goodbye  
If the planets collide don't run and hide change his mind  
Just believe it's your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find

Guru of the seen and heard

Fuzzy round the edges or making it clear  
Blinding us with those facts  
Chorus  
The power of the media will make up our minds  
The power of the media will take down our minds  
Written on the black and white page  
We can't believe what we read  
Tarting up reality has become the new rage  
Who said the truth is stranger than fiction  
A few white lies for a nice little sensation  
Buy up a paper you can influence the nation  
Little box in the corner  
A picture worth a thousand words  
But who chooses which pictures we see  
Who decides on the commentary  
Keeping people in a state of confusion  
There's a thin line between facts and illusion  
Diverting our attention from big brother in the city  
When will we get to the real nitty gritty

Free the fire in me  
Let it be  
Ignited in power  
Let me be  
Ablaze in this hour  
Like a torch that's passed for eternity  
So free the fire in me  
Let it show  
Like glowing devotion  
Let it go  
Like flames hot in motion  
For the world set is my burning desire  
So free the fire in me  
  
A man's true temperature is tested by his wealth  
Love only flickers if it's just to warm himself  
My treasure lies in you and fans the zeal of all I do  
It's rising and growing  
It can't be shared with just a few  
Everybody needs the light  
In my heart it's always burning bright  
So let the heat climb ever higher  
And free the fire in me

All by myself I don't know where I could begin  
I'm just a spark the quenches like a candle kindles in the wind  
Not by my ability

I'll do all that you require  
And free the fire in me

There will always be one more song for You  
As long as there is room for one more voice in praise  
And a need for a word of love and truth, to help my brother through  
There'll be one more song for You  
  
[Verse 1]  
You were there with your songs of laughter, words of hope for my fears  
But what are songs when no one will sing them,  
What are words when no one hears  
Everytime was filled with questions, and when I asked, no one knew  
Till I found the answer in You

Love is in the air around me, hope abounds everywhere  
Living life in the arms of Jesus, learning how to really care  
Every day is filled with purpose, all the old is made new  
And I know I owe it all to You

So as long as there is time, and one breath left in me

Indigo Girls,Play It Again Sam,/i/indigo+girls/play+it+again+sam_20067445.html,"Well we read best selling novels  
So we can talk between the lines  
And we often close our eyes  
Just to hide the dollar signs  
And were suddenly pretentious  
And conform with the stream  
Were born and bred believers  
In the american dream  
  
And we drink our whiskey straight  
Though we do not like the taste  
And we dress in obligations  
With a top hat show of haste  
And we hinder our reactions  
As we measure what we say  
Until someone starts to cry  
And the faces turn away again  
  
Play it again sam  
Take it slow and easy  
Sing about the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
And theres a man who will tip you  
Better than youve gotten yet  
If you play us a happy song  
And help us forget  
Play it again sam  
  
Well we donate to our charities  
To deduct our future taxes  
And we flock to bars for drinking  
Though one never quite relaxes  
And we compromise our standards  
If it means well get attention  
And the things we need the most to say  
Are the things we never mention  
  
Play it again sam  
Take it slow and easy  
Sing about the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
And theres a man who will tip you  
Better than youve gotten yet  
If you play us a happy song  
And help us all forget  
Play it again sam  
  
Now I know God is up in heaven  
Its hard to keep in mind  
Sometimes when youre searching for relief  
And hell is all you find  
And I know that I'm a romantic  
I might seem a fool to say  
I'm know I'm going to see a few hands joined  
Before my dying day  
  
Play it again sam  
Take it slow and easy  
Sing about the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
And theres a man who will tip you  
Better than youve gotten yet  
Just play us a happy song  
And help us all forget

Indigo Girls,Run,/i/indigo+girls/run_20537526.html,"You don?t want me calling you up  
All melancholy sick from love  
You prefer it uncomplicated  
Things are tricky now I bet you hate it  
Your mind?s eye finds the exit sign  
And you?re off in perfect fashion  
And you run, that?s all you?ve ever done  
It?s all you know to do  
I can?t hold that against you  
And you?ll flee cause you?re born to be free  
And if you go I?ll understand  
But you better get out while you can  
The party?s over, we had our fun  
Flirting with madness a loaded gun  
As much as nothing everything?s changed  
I?m soaking in it, it falls like rain  
You seek the sun to dry off what?s been done  
You?ll heat up every corner of the world  
As you run, that?s all you?ve ever done  
It?s all you know to do  
I can?t hold that against you  
And you?ll flee cause you?re born to be free  
And if you go I?ll understand  
But you better get out while you can  
Can you keep this pace forever  
I have never seen it done  
Up deep burn all you leave behind you  
You are the surface of my sun  
I measure to what degree  
I can shape up what?s been forged in me  
The cooper penny hissing in the pool  
So much for wishes so much for cooling  
Down this fire impossible desire  
The further you get the more I?m drawn  
And you run, that?s all you?ve ever done  
It?s all you know to do

He's a skitsofrantic, serial killer clown  
Who says, ""woman love his sexy smile""  
Let's find out if his charm will work on Sharon  
Sharon, what's your question?""  
  
""Contestant number one,  
I believe first impressions last forever  
So let's say you were to come over to my parent's house  
And have dinner with me and my family  
Tell me what you would do to make  
That first impression really stick""  
  
[Violent J]  
Let's see, uh, well, I'd have to think about it  
I might show up in a tux, HA!, but I doubt it  
I'd probably just show up naked like I always do  
And lick your momma in the eye and tell her, ""FUCK YOU!!!""  
Hurry up bitch, I'm hungry, I smell spaghetti  
I'd pinch her loopy ass and tell her, ""Get the food ready!""  
Your dad will probably start tripping and get me pissed  
I'd have to walk up and bust him in his fucking lips!  
It's dinner time, we hearing grace from your mother  
I pull a forty out and pour some for your little brother  
I'm steady staring at your sister, I'll tell you this  
You know for only 13, she got some big tits  
After that, your dad will try to jump again  
And only this time, I'd put the forty to his chin  
After you mom does the dishes and the silverware  
I'd dry-fuck her till I nut in my underwear  
  
""Now, let's me contestant number two  
He's a psychopathic, deranged, crackhead freak  
Who works for the Dark Carnival  
He says women call him stretch nuts  
Sharon, let's hear your question""  
  
""I like a man who's not afraid to show his true emotions  
A man who expresses himself in his own special way  
Number two, if you fell in love with me  
Exactly how would you let me know?""  
  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
First thing, I could never love you  
You sound like a richie-bitch, yo, FUCK YOU!!!  
But if I did, I'd probably show you that I care  
By taking all these other motherfuckers outta here  
I'd go through your phone book and whack em all  
And find contestant number one and break his fucking jaw (what?!)  
Anyone who looked at you, would have to pay  
I'd be blowing fucking nuggets off all day  
I'd grab your titties and stretch em down past your waist  
Let em go, and watch em both spring up in your face  
I'd sing love songs to you, the best I can  
Get you naked, and hit it like a CAVEMAN!!!  
When we go to the beach and walk through the sand  
I throw a little in your face and say, I'm just playin  
As you spit it all out, I'd rub your back  
And grab your underwear and wedge it up your ass crack!!  
  
""Well it sounds like contestant number two  
Is just over-flowing with sensativity, Sharon  
It's a touch choice so far  
Sharon, let's have your last question and  
See which one is going to win the rights to your neden""  
  
""Okay, if we were at a dance club, and you both noticed me at the  
same time. Tell me, how would you each get my attention, and what would  
your pick up line be? Well, whoever's the smoothest wins!""  
  
[Violent J]  
Okay, first I'd slide up to the bar  
And tell you that I can't believe how fucking fat you are  
I'd tell that I like the way you make your titties shake  
And if you lost a little weight, you'd look like Rickie Lake!  
  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Fuck that, you'd be jocking me quick  
I'd order you a drink and stir it with my dick  
And then to get your attention in the crowded place  
I'd simply walk up and stick my nuts in your face  
  
[Violent J]  
Yeah, freak with your nuts, yo, that'll get her  
Tell her that's she fat, yeah, that'll work even better  
Look, fuck you, I got a strong rap  
Shit, you don't want contestant number two  
He's mad-whack

I walk into a bar and there he was  
Standing up on a bucket, eww, trying to fuck it  
It was a big fucking smelly, ass farm llama

We got some fresh fills for your fat chicken-ass to snack on, bitch!  
So here, start with a slice of this fresh piggy pie, motherfucker!""  
  
The first little piggy, his house is made of wood  
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood  
He likes to fuck his sister, and drink his moonshine  
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine  
I rode into town with my axe in my holster  
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy roaster  
A farmer at the border, he tried to take me out  
I drew my ax with the quickness, and cut his chicken feathers out  
Walked in the village, and to the piggy's place  
He opened up his door, and popped me in the face  
And blew me off the porch, and cracked my head in half  
But I'm a Juggalo, so it only made me laugh (he he)  
Forty in hand, I rose from the dead  
And threw with all my might, I made a ping noise off his head  
Since we out west, I had a little fun  
And pulled his fuckin tongue out the back of his cranium  
  
[Chorus]  
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie  
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die  
I might use a gun (no), I might use an ax (yes)  
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!  
  
The second little piggy, his house is made of brick  
And this little piggy is a motherfucking dick  
He sits on his bench and gets all the respect  
But if I get a chance, I'm goin' straight for the neck  
He walked in the room, and everybody rose  
Lopped off bucket chillin' underneath my clothes  
First they let the piggy, now you can finally sit  
But what this piggy don't know is he's about to get his neck wet  
Now I see the bailiff, I'm thinkin' what the fuck?  
I can smoke this room before his hearing aid will pick it up  
Old-ass man, I let him get away  
That tired motherfucker will probably die tomorrow anyway  
Here come the piggy, it's time for my case  
His eyes are blood red with a wicked lookin' face  
He saw my joker's smile, and sentenced me to die  
So I ragged on the bucket, made it fuckin' rain pork rinds  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
The last little piggy, his house is made of gold  
He lives in a mansion on his own private road  
I started walking down it, the guard he told me wait  
I bounced off his head and did a Jackie Chan over the gate  
Cause this little piggy, must definitely fry  
I'm a lop his nugget off and toss it in the sky  
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil  
And pull it out the sky, and beat it with a shovel  
People in my city, they fightin' for they meals  
He sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills  
How rich he is the devil, he never will admit it  
So I'm a take his money stack and stuff his face with it  
Opened up his door, he's sleeping in his bed  
I grabbed a brick of gold and laid it upside his head  
He begged for his life, I told him it's too late  
And took away his dough and watched the devil suffocate  
Cause I need  
  
[Chorus: x4]

Insane Clown Posse,Sedatives,/i/insane+clown+posse/sedatives_10144856.html,"[Verse - Violent J]  
I like to suffocate people and bite their necks  
They got me in a place that ain't like the rest  
And all you gotta do is try to go for the neck  
And it's sedatives...sedatives...like that  
Slow down, color smear all around  
Weird sounds, you in the mind of a clown  
And a wicked one somehow spinnin' around  
Wheel me down the hallway, arms strapped down  
With sedatives.  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Hangin' all out the neck from the IV  
Sedatives for the lively  
Study me, ask me, no answer  
I'm cuttin' your neck first chance sir  
[Violent J]  
White walls, white floor, small rooms  
After sedatives, they become ballrooms  
Crows fly by my window slow  
Headed that way but lookin' at me though  
Sedatives.  
Sedatives.  
Sedative me.  
Sedatives.  
Sedative me.  
Sedatives.  
Sedatives.  
Sedatives.  
[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]  
I'm an accident, human malfunction at best  
And I'm lookin' at a scalpel diggin' into your chest  
If I could only move, but them sedatives  
You know they saving your life, them sedatives  
Some of these other patients are strong as hell  
Suffocating one creep took me long as hell  
But I took his sedatives, well I thought they were sedatives  
But they were only medatives.  
[Violent J]  
I fake pain, call 'em over and play dead  
And yank a fistful of hair out the nurse lady's head  
High on sedatives again, put me in a tiny place  
Chin strap muzzle over my face  
I threw a guy off the roof first day they admitted me  
I was sedated, and that's when it hit me  
The only time I'm at peace is when I ain't even there  
God tell me, why the fuck am I here?  
[Verse - Violent J]  
I want a lobotomy, no shock therapy  
Come clean me nurse, take care of me  
I suffocated the last 2 they sent in alone  
They had to stick me in the chest with a shot of methadone  
Recreation time, wheel me to the courtyard  
Four guards in white and they might be important  
And the sky is blue and I can watch trees grow  
Watch leaves flow, enjoy the sedative show  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Well I even have my very own room these days  
White straight jacket, padded walls and PJ's  
But there's so many ways and every stunt I pull  
I even slammed my own mouth down on the toilet bowl  
For attention? maybe, not to mention a sedative  
Heard one guy say ""why even let it live?""  
There's probably no sedatives in Hell  
And that's the only reason I'm alive still!  
[Violent J]  
The Witch is everywhere and I can see that y'all  
Stabbed one nurse in the neck with a straw  
A plastic straw, yet flimsy and weak  
But if you cork it with your thumb and hold it right..FREEEK!

Sunrise is gone, numbing all desires  
Sunrise is gone, Sunrise is gone  
  
Around the world the people stop with terror-stricken eyes  
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly  
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas there's nowhere left to run  
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Around the world the nations wait  
For some wise words from their leading light  
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools  
""Is this the end"" the millions cried  
Clutching their riches as they died  
Those who survive must weather the storm  
  
Gone are the days when man looked down  
They've taken away his sacred crown  
To be so free, it took so long  
It's not the journeys end, it's just begun

Irving Berlin,I Used To Be Color Blind,/i/irving+berlin/i+used+to+be+color+blind_20068121.html,"Strange  
How a dreary world can suddenly change  
To a world as bright as the evening star  
Queer  
What a difference when your vision is clear  
And you see things as they really are  
  
I used to be color-blind  
But I met you and now I find  
There's green in the grass  
There's gold in the moon  
There's blue in the skies  
  
That semi-circle that was always hanging about  
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow  
And you brought the colors out  
  
Believe me it's really true  
Till I met you I never knew  
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies  
  
I never knew there were such lovely colors  
And the big surprise  
Is the red in your cheeks  
The gold in your hair  
The blue in your eyes

Ask not what your country can do for you  
Ask what you can do for your country""  
  
Excuse me  
  
Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get Oscars  
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors  
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg  
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg  
Don't trip nigga, they just words  
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs  
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse  
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church  
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo  
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo  
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit  
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick  
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail  
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel  
Ill, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga  
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas  
  
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch  
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich  
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch  
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge  
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments

Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit

Just to floss pay any and every cost  
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out  
Am I about dollars or about change?  
Am I about knowledge or about brains?  
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain  
  
Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers  
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense  
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'  
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets  
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit  
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit  
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit  
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit  
Who the fuck was I?  
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side  
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at  
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back  
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack  
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat  
I'mma pass your classes, I'mma learn your craft

Given all the years  
All the cries and cheers  
Don't amount to much more than pride  
Take my love for you  
Take tomorrow too  
There's not much left inside  
  
How we laughed when we first knew love  
Singing dumb-de-lum-de-lie  
I taught you how to see life through love  
Then I taught you how to cry  
And though I must have known  
How easily love is thrown  
I took some chances, I don't know why  
There's not much you can do  
You wish that I'd been true  
Darlin' so do I

Go on and hold out  
Go ahead and hold out

Move on and hold out  
Don't let your love be sold out  
If there's anyone who knows about it  
Baby that's me

You can't forget the way I lied  
Time has seen you grow,  
To lead your life alone  
Though you tried and tried  
Cried and cried  
  
Baby I guess you know my story  
Maybe there's not much left to say  
You know the more we take the more we  
Turn each other's hearts away  
Now I'll be leaving in the morning  
Leaving half of me behind  
To find the pieces life's been torn in  
And take whatever love I find  
  
But you better hold out  
Go on and hold out  
Just walk away and hold out  
For what you know love can be  
Move on and hold out  
Don't let your love be sold out  
It's starting to be cold out  
For people who live like me  
Move on and hold out  
And somewhere later no doubt  
You'll find another hold out  
Someone just like you baby, wait and see

I'll fly away if you don't do something to make me stay  
I want to, but I can't be the only one to say I want you

Well, it wasn't hard to pull me to the ground  
Whether it was something that you taught me  
Or just something that I found  
Loving you is all that holds me down  
  
I'll fly away without you, I'll fly away without you

About the size of a fist  
Or something thrown that had missed

Far too many to repair  
In the time that we were there  
People speak of love don't know what they're thinking of  
Reach out to each other though the push and shove  
Speak in terms of a life and the learning  
Try to think of a word for the burning  
You keep it up  
You try so hard  
To keep a life from coming apart  
And never know  
What breaches and faults are concealed  
In the shape of a heart

On a stand beside the bed  
In the hour before dawn  
When I knew she was gone  
And I held it in my hand  
For a little while  
And dropped it into the wall  
Let it go, heard it fall

The shallows and the unseen reefs  
That are there from the start

Should one thing or another take you from behind  
Though the world may make you hard and wild  
And determine how your life is styled

Let the laughter fill your glass  
Let your illusions last until they shatter  
Whatever you might hope to find  
Among the thoughts that crowd your mind  
There won't be many that ever really matter  
  
But take good care of your mother  
And remember to be kind  
When the pain of another will serve you to remind  
That there are those who feel themselves exiled  
On whom the fortune never smiled  
And upon whose life the heartache has been piled  
They're just looking for another  
Lonely child  
  
And when you've found another soul  
Who sees into your own  
Take good care of each other

Come back, and believe the magic of love.

I want the sky without the sun, yeah!  
When do the stars and the moon reach out ?  
When they see me alone without my loved one, yeah!

Dressed in mystic silk  
Or wearing rich rags and waste,

Part of a magic race.  
  
Come back, and believe my love  
Baby, come back, please believe my love,  
Come back and believe the magic of love.  
  
Hey! Now come back, babe, and believe my love  
Come back, please believe my love

To leave me one more time, I can't stand no more  
Say no more, well no more,  
Well no more, darling, please.

Oh, I can't stand your loving, honey, it's tearing me apart,  
You done got my soul, but now you're after my heart.  
Well, don't hurt me, darling, now you know how to do it so well

A supernatural nightlight  
So full but often right  
A pair of eyes a closin' one  
A chosen child of golden sun  
A marble dog that chases cars  
To farthest reaches of the beach and far beyond into the swimming sea of stars  
  
A cosmic fish they love to kiss  
They're giving birth to constellation  
No riffs and oh no reservation  
If they should fall you get a wish or dedication  
May I suggest you get the best  
For nothing less than you and I  
Let's take a chance as this romance is rising over before we lose the lighting  
Oh bella bella please  
Bella you beautiful luna  
Oh bella do you do  
Do do do do do  
  
You are an illuminated anchor  
Of leads to infinite number  
Crashing waves and breaking thunder  
Tiding the evenflows of hunger  
You're dancing naked there for me  
You expose all memory  
You make the most of boundary  
You're the ghost of royalty imposing love  
You are the queen and king combining everything  
Into twining like a ring around the finger of a girl  
I'm just a singer, you're the world  
All I can bring ya  
Is the language of a lover  
Bella luna, my beautiful, beautiful moon  
How you swoon me like no other  
  
May I suggest you get the best  
Of your wish may I insist  
That no contest for little you or smaller I  
A larger chance happened, all them they lie  
On the rise, on the brink of our lives  
Bella please  
Bella you beautiful luna

You can be Jane my wife. Should I marry Jane tonight?  
  
I would if I could. I'd do most anything spontaneously.

We can cool in the gang if you'd rather hang  
Ain't no thing. I can be lacubrious with you.

You know I would, if I could. I'll do anything spontaneously.  
  
If you could be nimble, you'd have it simple just like me.  
So go on and try it, do not deny yourself your freedom.  
  
So step on up to the plate get a date with mraz  
See you better act fast because supplies they never  
Now did you know this is limited time offer  
So go make your mind up before our times up  
You better start winding it up because the party's almost over

Made from holy water

She's got little scales upon her  
She's larger than life

She's got a set of gills, like no fish I've ever seen  
Long blonde hair and a tail in between  
I'm in love with a creature from the sea  
And she's bringin' out the crustacean in me  
  
Her voice is a temptation it's a siren song  
When we kiss there could be no wrong  
I ask her to marry me, to be my wife  
And we could do the backstroke for the rest of our lives

On the backbone of this mighty land  
The continental divide  
To the place where earth and heaven meet  
The mountains and the sky

""My mother won't mind  
And my father won't slight you  
For your lack of kind""  
And she stepp'd away from me  
And this she did say  
""It will not be long, love  
Till our wedding day""  
  
She stepp'd away fromme  
And went through the fair  
And fondly I watch'd her  
Move here and move there  
And then she went homeward  
With one star awake  
As the swan in the evening  
Moves over the lake  
  
The people were saying  
That no two e'er were wed  
And one had a sorrow  
That never was said  
And I smiled as she passed  
With her goods and her gear  
And that was the last  
That I saw my dear  
  
Last night she came to me  
She came softly in  
So softly she came  
That her feet made no din  
And she placed her hand on me  
And this she did say  
""Oh it will not be long, love  
Till our wedding day""

Sat the fat girl daughter of virginia and ray

Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat  
Behind her small eyes sunk deep in her fat.  
She read romance magazines up in her room  
And felt just like sunday on saturday afternoon.

Like the first breath from a baby,  
Like sunshine feeding daisies,  
Like the love hidden deep in your heart.

A warehouse of strangers with sixty watt lights.  
Staring through the ceiling, just wanting to be  
Lay one of too many, a young pfc:

Strangers had forced him to live in his head.  
He envisioned the details of romantic scenes  
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks latrine.

Hot love, cold love, no love at all.  
A portrait of guilt is hung on the wall.  
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right.  
Donald and lydia made love that night.

Love  
The made love in the mountains, they made love in the streams,  
They made love in the valleys, they made love in their dreams.  
But when they were finished there was nothing to say,  
'cause mostly they made love from ten miles away.

As long as the moon shall rise...  
The Iroquios Indians used to rule from Canada way south  
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth  
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site  
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right  
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way  
They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinuza dam is here to stay  
Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea  
So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy  
As long as the moon shall rise...  
Washington Adams and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring  
The treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling  
It's the back water from Perfidy Lake it's rising all the time  
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine  
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill  
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill  
But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow  
The father of our country must be wrong what's an Indian anyhow  
As long as the moon shall rise (look up) as long as the rivers flow (are you
thirsty)  
As long as the sun will shine (my brother are you warm) as long as the grass
shall grow

I was breaking into a schoolhouse Sunday morning without warning  
When I saw the sheriff coming for me slow from down below  
  
His steel gray eyes were blazing when he saw me  
His hand was on his gun when he rode up  
He said you killed that woman I know you shot her why'd you do it  
I'm taking you to Austin then I'm gonna lock you up  
  
Well he tied me with a plow line the next morning  
And he had me deep in Texas the next day  
A crazy screaming lynch mob waited in the streets of Austin  
But he put me in the jailhouse and he threw the key away  
  
A jury found me guilty three months later twelve evil men with murder in their

They even took me out and said now show us where you killed her  
And that wicked judge said now I here by sentence you to die

On his clarinet, for free  
  
Now me I play for fortunes  
And those velvet curtain calls  
I've got a black limousine  
And two gentlemen  
Escorting me to the halls  
And I play if you have the money  
Or if you're a friend to me  
But the one man band  
By the quick lunch stand  
He was playing real good, for free  
  
Nobody stopped to hear him  
Though he played so sweet and high  
They knew he had never  
Been on their T.V.  
So they passed his music by  
I meant to go over and ask for a song  
Maybe put on a harmony...  
I heard his refrain  
As the signal changed

And Eagles The Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone  
Faded out with ragtime blues  
Handy's cast in bronze  
And he's standing in a little park  
With a trumpet in his hand  
Like he's listening back to the good old bands  
And the click of high heeled shoes  
Old Furry sings the blues  
Propped up in his bed  
With his dentures and his leg removed  
And Ginny's there  
For her kindness and Furry's beer  
She's the old man's angel overseer  
  
Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps  
In the gray decay  
They chew the last few dollars off  
Old Beale Street's carcass  
Carrion and mercy  
Blue and silver sparkling drums  
Cheap guitars, eye shades and guns  
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one  
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee  
Old Furry sings the blues  
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you  
It's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel  
But there was one song he played  
I could really feel  
  
There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy  
The old girl's silent across the street  
She's silent, waiting for the wrecker's beat  
Silent, staring are her stolen name  
Diamond boys and satin dolls  
Bourbon laughter, ghosts, history falls  
To parking lots and shopping malls  
As they tear down old Beale Street  
Old Furry sings the blues  
He points a bony finger at you and  
""I don't like you""  
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke  
But it's true  
We're only welcome for our drink and smoke

And I'm not familiar with what you played  
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day  
Looking up and down old Beale Street  
Ghosts of the darktown society  
Come right out of the bricks at me  
Like it's a Saturday night  
They're in their finery  
Dancing it up and making deals  
Furry sings the blues  
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true  
Fallen to hard luck  
And time and other thieves  
While our limo is shining on his shanty street  
Old Furry sings the blues

Blind rage to kill

With the madness left inside of me, oh

I had my petticoat trimmed with lace  
I looked at the mirror, around I twirled  
And then I went out in the wide, wide world  
  
I dreamed of gentlemen I would meet  
I saw them all kneeling at my feet  
I can't understand it, my hair is all curled  
But my goodness me, it's a great big world

Alas and a lack, it's a great big world.

I even frosted an angel cake  
On Saturday evening, when folks dropped in  
My house was as neat as a brand new pin  
  
I thought by learning each social grace  
A chap might learn to forget my face  
I can't understand it, I've knitted and pearled  
But my goodness me it's a great big world!

I had no petticoat trimmed with lace  
My angel cake was a sure disgrace  
My face was my fortune, my mother said  
And my dancing slippers of bright, bright red.  
  
A million miles I've danced or more  
In hopes Prince Charming would cross the floor  
I can't understand it, I've Waltzed and I've whirled  
But my goodness me, it's a great big world.  
  
[Chorus x 2]

My slippers are one thing I never will sell  
My petticoat's waiting, because who can tell?

Lets take a journey  
  
[Verse 1]  
[Katy Perry]  
I know a place  
Where the grass is really greener  
Warm, wet and wild  
There must be something in the water  
  
Sippin' gin and juice  
Laying underneath the palm trees  
The boys break their necks  
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek  
(at us)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You could travel the world  
But nothing comes close to the golden coast  
Once you party with us  
You'll be falling in love  
  
Oooooh Oh Oooooh  
  
[Chorus]  
California girls  
We're unforgettable  
Daisy Dukes  
Bikinis on top  
  
Sun-kissed skin  
So hot  
We'll melt your popsicle

Hands up

Sex on a beach  
We get sand in our stilletos  
We freak in my jeep  
So do the doggie on the stereo

You could travel the world  
But nothing comes close to the golden coast  
Once you party with us  
You'll be falling in love

Feeling so high but looking so low  
Party favors on the floor  
Group of girls banging on the door  
So many new fair-weather friends oh

Have you ever been so lost  
Known the way and still so lost  
  
Caught in the eye of a hurricane  
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade  
So sick of this town pulling me down  
My mother says I should come back home but  
Can't find the way cause the way is gone  
So if I pray am I just sending words into outer space

Another night waiting for someone to take me home  
Have you ever been so lost  
  
Is there a light  
Is there a light  
At the end of the road  
I'm pushing everyone away  
'Cause I can't feel this anymore  
Can't feel this anymore

Well I pledge my wife to heaven, for the gospel,  
Though our love each passing day just seems to grow.  
As I told her when we wed, Id surely rather be found dead,  
Than to love her more than the one who saved my soul.  
Im your child, and I want to be in your family forever.  
Im your child, and Im going to follow you,  
No matter whatever the cost, Im gonna count all things lost.  
  
Well I pledge my son to heaven for the gospel.  
Though hes kicked and beaten, ridiculed and scorn.  
I will teach him to rejoice, and life a thankful praising voice,  
And to be like him who bore the nails and crown of thorns.  
Im your child, and I want to be in your family forever.  
Im your child, and Im going to follow you,  
No matter whatever the cost, Im gonna count all things lost.  
Oh no matter whatever the cost, Im gonna count all things lost.  
  
Well Ive had the chance to gain the world, and to live just like a king,  
But without your love, it doesnt mean a thing.  
Oh no matter whatever the cost, Im gonna count all things lost,  
Oh no matter whatever the cost, Im gonna count all things lost.

Keith Green,The Prodigal Son Suite,/k/keith+green/the+prodigal+son+suite_20077391.html,"I was done hoeing, out in the fields for the day,  
I was thinking of going, I had to leave right away,  
My life is just fading, and oh I felt so alone,  
The nearest young maiden was, a full day's ride from home.  
  
My father was reading, the holy books in his room,  
My heart was just bleeding, I knew I had to go soon,  
He smiled and pointed at an old wooden chair,  
I wanted to hold him, but then I just wouldn't dare.  
  
I said, father, there's so much to know,  
There's a world of things to see,  
And I'm ready to go and make a life for myself  
If you give me what is mine,  
I will go, if I can have your blessing,  
But if you won't bless my journey, I'm gonna leave anyway.  
Son, I've always tried my best for you,  
And if you must be leaving home, then go with the blessing of God.  
  
Not too many days later, I was well on my way,  
I met a travelling stranger, who seemed to have much to say,  
He told me tales of the city, and all the women he'd had,  
I asked him, wasn't that sinful,  
He said, no, it isn't that bad.  
And then a few days later, on an old city road,  
We were drowning in laughter, and we had women to hold,  
And this went on quite a long time, my father gave me a lot,  
But when my pockets were empty, my friends all left me to rot.  
  
Then a famine hit and drained the land,  
Everywhere I looked I saw starvation, and a job was so hard to find,  
I wandered through the city streets, competing for the food of common beggers,  
Until then I'd never known hunger, but now I wasn't too proud.  
I finally found some employment, feeding pigs on a farm,  
I wasn't treated to kindly, I had to sleep in the barn,  
I had to eat with the swine,  
The bread I ate was like stone,  
It didn't take too much time until, I was dreaming of home.  
Oh, the servants there are better fed,  
If I could only have what my father gives them,  
I would truly need nothing more.  
Oh, I will go and say to him,  
I'm no longer worthy to be in your family,  
Will you take me as your servant, and let me live with them.  
  
It didn't take too long to pack my things,  
I left with only what I wore,  
As I prayed that I still had a home.  
I was near home, in site of the house,  
My father just stared, dropped open his mouth,  
He ran up the road, and fell to my feet, and cried, and cried,  
Father I've sinned, heaven ashamed,  
I'm no longer worthy to wear your name,  
I've learned that my home is right where you are,  
Oh father, take me in.  
Bring the best robe, put it on my son,  
Shoes for his feet, hurry put them on,  
This is my son who I thought had died,  
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,  
I've prayed and prayed, never heard a sound,  
My son was lost, oh thank you God he's found,  
My son was dead and he's now alive,  
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,  
My son was dead,  
My son was lost,  
My son's returned in the hands of God.

You were a part of me  
I used to stand so tall  
I used to be so strong  
Your arms around me tight  
Everything, it felt so right  
Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong  
  
Now I can't breathe  
No, I can't sleep  
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am  
Once again  
I'm torn into pieces  
Can't deny it  
Can't pretend  
Just thought you were the one  
Broken up deep inside  
But you won't get to see the tears I cry  
Behind these hazel eyes  
  
I told you everything  
Opened up and let you in  
You made me feel alright for once in my life  
Now all that's left of me  
Is what I pretend to be  
So together but so broken up inside  
  
'Cause I can't breathe  
No, I can't sleep  
I'm barely hanging on

In every house and on every street  
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Their names are written in concrete  
  
Don't step on Greta Garbo as you walk down the Boulevard  
She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard  
But they turned her into a princess  
And they sat her on a throne  
But she turned her back on stardom  
Because she wanted to be alone  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain  
  
Rudolph Valentino looks very much alive  
And he looks up ladies dresses as they sadly pass him by  
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi  
'Cause he's liable to turn and bite  
But stand close by Bette Davis  
Because her's was such a lonely life  
  
If you covered him with garbage  
George Sanders would still have style  
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney  
He would still turn round and smile  
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn  
Cause she's not very tough  
She should have been made of iron or steel  
But she was only made of flesh and blood  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain  
  
Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star  
And everybody's in show biz, it doesn't matter who you are  
And those who are successful  
Be always on your guard  
Success walks hand in hand with failure  
Along Hollywood Boulevard  
  
I wish my life was non-stop Hollywood movie show  
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes  
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
And celluloid heroes never really die

Takin' all the whole world all by myself  
But it's not enough  
Unless I stop trusting somebody else,  
Somebody else  
And love again

And from the start  
Maybe we were tryin' too hard  
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts  
Things can fall apart but I know,  
That I don't want you to go, no  
Maybe we were tryin' to hard  
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts  
Things can fall apart but I know,

Kyla,Someone To Love,/k/kyla/someone+to+love_20260404.html,"Never thought I'd fall in love again  
To find the pieces of the puzzle  
Life cannot begin  
The search begins with knowing  
I need you  
Could not imagine in my dreams  
That you need me too  
Someone to love  
All my dreams have come true  
Now that I've found you  
Someone to love  
Alone I feel no more  
Since you unlocked the door to my heart  
There was an empty void inside my heart  
I tried to fill the space with anything  
But left it in the dark  
Then a blessing came in the form of you  
Now I know that God has smiled on me too  
Someone to love  
All my dreams have come true  
Now that I've found you  
Someone to love  
Alone I feel no more  
Since you unlocked the door to my heart  
I didn't know when it would come  
All I know is that I wanted someone  
To take me far away from my loneliness  
So I thank you, I thank you coming  
Into my life  
Someone to love  
All my dreams have come true  
Now that I've found you  
Someone to love

It might be hard to be lovers  
But its harder to be friends  
Baby pull down the covers  
Its time you let me in  
Maybe light a couple candles  
Ill just go ahead and lock the door  
If you just talk to me baby  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
Lay your head on my pillow  
I sit beside you on the bed  
Dont you think its time we say  
Some things we havent said  
It aint too late to get back to that place  
Back to where, we thought it was before  
Why dont you look at me  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
Sometimes its hard to love me  
Sometimes its hard to love you too  
I know its hard believing  
That love can pull us through  
It would be so easy  
To live your life  
  
With one foot out the door  
Just hold me baby  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
[Solo]  
  
Its hard to find forgivness  
When we just run out of lies  
Its hard to say youre sorry  
When you cant tell wrong from right  
It would be so easy  
To spend your whole damn life  
Just keeping score  
So lets get down to it baby  
There aint no need to lie  
  
Tell me who you think you see  
When you look into my eyes  
Lets put our two hearts back together  
And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor  
Make love with me baby  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
We're not strangers anymore  
We're not strangers  
We're not strangers anymore

Plowmen dig my earth

While all the women came and went  
Bare feet servants too  
Outside in the cold distance

Two riders were aproaching now  
And the wind began to howl

The club was far from empty  
It was crowded at the entry  
I slide right through like how I do  
This girl began to tempt me.  
She said her name Shaiyeeda  
I could tell her mama feed her  
When they tight and when them jeans don't fit  
I'm L, nice to meet ya.  
I could feel my body yearnin'  
The room just started turnin'  
Didn't wanna go out on the floor  
But this girl was so determined (Let's dance)  
My brain began to sizzle  
I'm sweatin' just a little  
On the dance floor in the middle,  
She turned around and giggled,  
She said  
  
You got, you got, you got  
What it takes to make me leave my man  
  
It's hard to control myself

Temptation is a mother,  
How we lust for one another  
We barely know eachother  
Yet we're whilin' like we're lovers (uh huh)  
The air is filled with passion  
The strobe lights are flashin'  
The hustlers throw cash n  
The bar tender keeps splashin'  
Her moves were so erotic  
Her games were so hypnotic  
I bet this girl could stop it  
But she continued to pop it  
  
You know I know you like it,  
Let me hit you on your sidekick  
Cause the after party is at my body,  
Meet me, you're invited

What it takes to make me leave my man

Her lip gloss  
Her hips toss  
Back and forth  
Side to side and  
Up and down  
She touched the ground  
It turned me out.  
I'm battlin' desire,  
Lord help me douse this fire  
This internal inferno,  
Hotter than a shot of cuervo  
Her top was short and purple  
Belly dancin' in a circle  
When I feel like this I can't resist  
I ? don't make me hurt you

When she wet, ain't no controllin' the heat  
For baguettes she give love to ill thugs  
Age of 15 she learned to pump drugs  
Then she got pregnant, abandoned the kid  
Met this drug kid, set him up and slid  
Now she 23 full blown in the mix

It was an inside trader eating a rubber tire  
after running over Rudy Giuliani  
They say the President's dead

It's been missing now for weeks  
But no one noticed it  
he has seemed so fit

We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes  
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes  
A fine romance, you won't nestle  
A fine romance, you won't wrestle  
I might as well play bridge  
With my old maid aunt  
I haven't got a chance  
This is a fine romance  
  
A fine romance, my good fellow  
You take romance, I'll take jello  
You're calmer than the seals  
In the arctic ocean  
At least they flap their fins  
To express emotion  
A fine romance with no quarrels  
With no insults and all morals  
I've never mussed the crease  
In your blue serge pants  
I never get the chance  
This is a fine romance

Ooh baby, I love you

Ooh baby, I need you  
I miss you more every day  
  
I woke up early this mornin'  
And the sun came shining down  
And it found me wishin' and hopin'  
Mama you could be around  
For you know I need you  
More than the air I breathe  
And I guess I'm just tryin' to tell you, woman  
Oh, what you mean to me, yeah yeah  
  
Ooh baby, I love you  
What more can I say?  
Ooh baby, I need you  
I miss you more every day  
  
I'm tryin' to tell you I love you  
In each and every way  
I'm tryin' to tell you I need you  
Much more than a piece of lay  
  
Ooh baby, I love you  
What more can I say?  
Ooh baby, I need you  
I miss you more every day  
  
Ooh baby I love you  
What more can I say  
Oh baby I need your sweet lovin'

We're closin' ourselves in  
If you watch the news it'll scare you to death  
To hell and back again  
The only justice here's at the wrong end of a gun  
Got the criminal makin' the laws got the good men on the run  
I've seen enough  
  
We don't own anything we've got we've givin' it all away  
But that don't make no sense to me you know who's gonna pay  
It's the man in the factory workin' twelve hours a day  
The woman workin' in the restaurant with another kid on the way  
  
[Chorus]  
Isn't anything in this life sacred anymore  
We can't lose what we've got it's worth fightin' for  
I've seen enough, I've seen enough to make a grown man cry  
  
A man's standin' by the road a sign in his hand  
He don't want your charity he says I ain't no beggar man  
All I need is a chance to get back on my feet  
But we just pass him by well it could be you or me  
I've seen enough  
I ain't the kind to just sit back and watch the world go 'round  
It's not too late to change let's turn this shit around

Counting miles, counting tears  
Twist of roads, shifting gears  
Year after year  
It's all or nothing

Wild horses on the plains  
You can call me lost, I call it freedom

Goodnight and thank you Huevo  
She is in every magazine  
Been photographed, seen, she is known  
We don't like to rush, but your case has been packed  
If she's missed anything, you could give her a ring  
But she won't always answer the phone  
  
(Eva:)  
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies  
But we have pretended enough  
It's best that we both stop fooling ourselves  
  
(Che:)  
Which means...  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Che and Eva:)  
There is no one, no one at all  
Never has been, and never will be a lover, male or female  
Who hasn't an eye on, in fact they rely on  
Tricks they can try on their partner  
They're hoping their lover will help them or keep them  
Support them, promote them  
Don't blame them, you're the same  
  
(Che:)  
Goodnight and thank you Emilio  
You've completed your task  
What more can we ask of you now?  
Please sign the book on the way out the door  
And that will be all, if she needs you she'll call  
But I don't think that's likely somehow  
  
(Eva:)  
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies  
But when we were hot, we were hot  
I know you'll look back on the good times we've shared  
Which means ...

Them"", sung only by Che)  
  
(Eva:)  
There is no soap, no soap like Zaz  
No detergent, lotion, or oil with such power in the shower  
It's the mother and father of luxury lather  
The talk of the bath, the great ointment  
One little frolic with new Zaz carbolic  
You're scented, you'll be sent  
  
(Che:)  
Goodnight and thank you Senor Jabon  
We are grateful you found her a spot on the sound radio  
We'll think of you every time she's on the air  
We'd love you to stay but you'd be in the way  
So do up your trousers and go  
  
(Eva:)  
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies  
The decline into silence and doubt  
Our passion was just too intense to survive  
  
(Che:)  
Which means ...  
  
(Lovers:)  
This is a club I should never have joined  
Someone has made us look fools  
Argentine men call the sexual shots  
Someone has altered the rules  
  
(Eva:)  
Fame on the wireless as far as it goes  
Is all very well but every girl knows  
  
(Che:)  
She needs a man she can monopolize  
With fingers in dozens of different pies

Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor  
Super natural love conquers all, remember we  
Used to touch the sky  
And lighting don't strike  
The same place twice, when you and I,  
Said goodbye I felt the angels cry

But we let it drift in a storm

Bring it back and we gon' make it right

In a whirlwind  
Here I am walkin' on this narrow rope wobbling  
But won't let go, waitin' for a glimpse of the sun's glow

Crying midst my rubber plants, ignoring beckoning doors  
Clippings from ancient newspapers lie scattered cross the floor  
Stained by the wine from a shattered glass

Yellowed by time  
Faded photos exposing pain  
Celluloid leeches bleeding my mind

Ivy caresses the wall  
Needles make love to the junkies

It seems the only things I know are far from home

Striking the canvas with deep blues and greens

Silver winged they fly, they know the call of freedom in their breasts  
Soar Black Head against the sky  
Between the rocks that run down to the sea  
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets, asked for more  
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland  
Talking all the day with true friends, who try to make you stay  
Telling jokes and news, singing songs to pass the night away  
Watched the Galway salmon run like silver dancing darting in the sun  
Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets, asked for more  
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland  
Drinking all the day in old pubs where fiddlers love to play  
Someone touched the bow, he played a reel, it seemed so fine and gay  
Stood on Dingle beach and cast, in wild foam we found Atlantic Bass  
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more  
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland  
Dreaming in the night, I saw a land where no man had to fight  
Waking in your dawn, I saw you crying in the morning light  
Lying where the Falcons fly, they twist and turn all in your rare blue sky

Clinging to a love that can't be saved  
Hanging off the edge of every word

That I'm willing to let you go?""  
At the tip of my tongue the answer was ""yes""  
But, at the bottom of my heat I'm wondering  
  
Did I say that?  
Did I say that?  
Sometimes you know I over react  
And what I say is not a matter of fact  
I wish that I could take it all back  
  
And you know I'd drag myself through fire at your side  
And you know the gates of Heaven are surely open wide  
And I need some sympathy here  
And I need someone to call my own  
I'm standing in the light of my mistakes  
And begging you, ""come home.""  
  
And I know you need some time to run and hide  
But the truth is hard to swallow when you're choking on your pride  
  
So I asked myself, ""Do I love you so much  
That I'm willing to let you go?""  
At the tip of my tongue the answer was ""yes""  
But, at the back of my mind I'm wondering  
  
Did I say that?  
Did I say that?  
Sometimes you know I over react  
And what I say is not a matter of fact  
I wish that I could take it all back  
But I said that  
  
And I wish I could take it all back  
  
And I need some sympathy here  
And I want a love to call my own  
I want to take you in the back seat now  
And slowly drive you home  
  
And I know you need some time to run and hide  
But the truth is hard to swallow when you're  
Choking on your pride  
I don't want to be this wide-awake  
  
Fighting for a love that I can't save  
And hanging off the edge of every word you say  
Knowing that it might make me cry  
I don't want to be this complicating  
You can drag it out but I'll be waiting  
I stumbled on ""I love you"" tonight  
But it sounded like goodbye  
  
Did I say that?  
Did I say that?  
Did I tell you that I loved you cause if  
Would have been a matter of fact  
  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm not letting go  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll have and I'll hold  
Did I tell you that I loved you cause it  
Would have been a matter of fact  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm walking through fire  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll feed your desire  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll stand by your side  
Did I say that?  
This time I will be your pride  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm not letting go  
Did I say that?  
This time I'll have and I'll hold  
Did I say that?  
This time I'm walking through fire  
Did I say that?  
And I wish that I could take it all back  
  
So this is what it feels like  
To be the one left behind  
To give it all you've got then find  
That you've already changed your mind

I is for insane  
It smells like danger  
J is for jump off the ship  
Or the storm will take you  
  
And who's gonna save me, now, oh...  
  
Chorus:  
You've taken me under  
You've stolen my thunder  
And I think I'm all out of fire  
Want you to win  
All that I ever was  
Is burning in this lust  
Your love is a weapon  
And it's turning me to dust  
D is for dangerous (4x)  
  
K is for killing me  
L is for I can't leave  
Oh, 'cause I'll never make it  
If I'm not living on the edge  
And for the rest  
Let's just forget  
'Cause I never want out of this...

And these tears I'm cyin' out

You were always on my side

Complicated and consuming?  
Why does all this make me angry?

Miley Cyrus,My Sad Christmas Song,/m/miley+cyrus/my+sad+christmas+song_21105348.html,"[Intro]  
Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
I've had it stuck in my head all day long  
I wrote it in the car on my ride home  
Cause I knew I'd walk in the door and I'd be alone  
Why'd I even put up that fuckin' tree?  
If there's no one here that's gonna see  
Just how pretty she looks on Christmas Eve  
Cause there's no one here next to me  
  
[Chorus 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I light another bong  
I turn on the radio  
I binge watch our favorite shows  
This year feels kind of lame  
But the last one was the same  
But the holiday spirit they say  
Is taking off on a plane  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 2]  
I always thought that Santa was kind of cute  
There's something about his beard, big belly, and boots  
I left Santa more than cookies this year  
I thought he might appreciate a few beers  
That's why I'm always on the naughty list  
He said cause when I get drunk, I'm always showing my tits  
He leaned in for a kiss and he got real near  
I had to stop Santa and say ""My true love ain't here""  
  
[Chorus 2]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I rip another bong  
I never been good at making plans  
Next year, I'm gonna be with my man  
My little sister says I'm the Grinch  
But my mom thinks I'm just a bitch  
Why did you have to go?  
We were under the mistletoe  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala  
  
[Bridge]  
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas, why did you have to go?  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas, know I miss you so  
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas, why did you have to go?

Of the incredible power it holds  
Against anything will victory bring  
In the trial of the soul  
  
For the sword that you hold  
Draws it's power from your soul  
Quicker than light, cutting deep in the night  
Where evil blood runs cold  
So to the bold  
Prepare the weapon you must hold  
And ask of the Lord  
Victory to our swords

The fact that I have to stick two of them together to even get on out of it

For the whole human race

All the music of life seems to be  
Like a bell that is ringing for me

When the bell starts to peal  
I would swear I was falling  
I could swear I was falling  
It's almost like being in love

My father will be pacing the floor, listen to that fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry, oh beautiful, please don't hurry  
Well, maybe just a half a drink more  
Why don't you put some music on while I pour  
  
The neighbors will think, baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink, there's no cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how, your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell, I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

At least I'm gonna say that I tried  
Oh, what's the sense in hurting my pride  
I really can't stay, baby don't hold out, ah, but it's cold outside

You don't need your coat

This welcome has been, lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm, look out that window at that storm  
  
My sister will be suspicious, please but your lips look so delicious  
My brother will be there at the door, waves upon a tropical shore  
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious, oh but your lips look delicious

You've really been grand, I trill when you touch my hand  
But don't you see, how can you do this thing to me  
  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow, think of my lifelong sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied, if you caught pneumonia and died  
I really can't stay, get over that old out

Baby, it's cold outside, baby, it's cold outside

On my knees and thanking God for all the  
Little things that make me wanna say  
How I wish I had a million days like these  
  
Life is running like a dream  
I know I can do anything

Eyes closed  
Touch the freedom  
Never let it go

You've been heartache and more  
I know 'cause girl  
I've walked that road before  
But baby,  
You can just forget  
That word called cry  
'Cause I'll be there right beside you  
  
And, I got love for you,  
Baby all I got to give.  
I got love for you for as long as I live  
Let me see your smile now, girl  
  
Baby don't look back  
To where you've been  
It won't ever be that way again  
There's not a lot of things  
That I got plenty of  
But love believe what I'm sayin',  
  
Cause, I got love for you  
Baby all I got to give  
I got love for you for as long as I live  
It's gotta be alright now  
  
There'll be no one doin' you harm  
No, don't be afraid, child  
Love, you're safe in my arms  
Gonna be no hurt, never no more  
No pain, not like before  
No fears, baby, for sure  
Just love forever more  
  
Cause, I got love for you  
Baby all I got to give  
I got love for you for as long as I live  
So hold me tight now  
So hold me tight now,  
Baby......

Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
You can see that I'm sorry  
For runnin' 'round with someone new  
But I know you don't mean it  
And mister till I think you do  
You can keep al your hugs  
Don't want your kisses  
You had to many tries  
And too many misses  
  
Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
If you think that I'm greedy  
For wanting you all to myself  
Well you're right, yes indeedy  
I won't share your love with no one else  
And if you think  
That your lies are gonna hurt me  
Well you just think again  
'Cause you don't know me  
  
Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
You make me think everything is ok  
Then you go out and play the field  
And make me play the fool  
  
Go and say that you're sorry  
I can't live on apologies  
If you want all my loving  
Then there will have to be some guarantees  
Say you'll settle down and in addition  
Say that you'll eliminate the competition  
  
Make up your mind what you want  
Nathaniel B Jackson  
  
This time I mean what I say  
Hey

So I'm headin' for the lights of town  
Gonna kiss the country life goodbye  
I got myself a brand new high  
  
Funky music where the lights are bright  
Tell the ladies I'll be there tonight  
It's a paradise of push and shove  
I gotta get back to the streets I love

I tried to fake it I couldn't make it  
Down in my soul I'm a city boy, city boy  
I tried to hide it, it's been decided  
Don't you just know I'm a city boy, boy  
Oh I gotta satisfy it  
Take me up town and let me boogie all night long  
Oh I hate the peace and quiet  
I gotta yell, I gotta shout, I gotta dance till I burn myself out  
  
I gotta be me, I gotta be free  
Welcome me home I'm a city boy, city boy  
And now I know it, well don't I show it  
Mama take a look at your city boy, city boy  
  
Music  
  
Bring it on home, bring it on home to me  
Bring it on home, bring it on home to me  
  
It's the only place I've ever been  
Where they never pull the sidewalks in  
Life's a party and you can't go wrong  
Cos Saturday night lasts a whole week long  
  
I tried to fake it I couldn't make it  
Down in my soul I'm a city boy, city boy  
I tried to hide it, it's been decided  
Don't you just know I'm a city boy, boy

Neil Sedaka,Love In The Shadows,/n/neil+sedaka/love+in+the+shadows_20249032.html,"In the shadows  
You get to know your lover mostly by feel  
Got to put your faith in things you can touch  
If you dare to  
'Cause the shadows can make you crazy  
With the things they reveal  
They show it all without revealing too much  
Scare the hell out of you  
'Cause me and my love  
Live among the shadows  
Where the old playground is an alley way  
Now me and my love make love among the shadows  
When the sun goes down in a dark hallway  
Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes  
Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow  
Me and my baby know love in the shadows  
In the shadows  
You got to work at love to get it to shine  
You can't believe in everything that you see  
Not this time around  
'Cause the shadows can play  
A half a million tricks on your mind  
You try your best but you can never break free  
It just kind of drags you down  
'Cause me and my love  
Live among the shadows  
Where the old playground is an alley way  
Now me and my love make love among the shadows  
When the sun goes down in a dark hallway  
Love in the shadows where the sun never shines  
Deep in the shadows where most men go blind  
Me and my baby find love in the shadows

In my old pickup truck  
A beautiful bluebird came flyin' down  
My eyes caught the color  
As it lead me down the road  
Dippin' and bobbin' in the sun  
I've never seen that blue before  
'Cept in one place  
And she's not here with me right now  
So I followed all the way  
To the top of the hill  
That's where she kept on climbin' lord  
Someday I will

Beautiful bluebird  
See how she flies  
Looks like she's always goin' home  
If heaven had a window  
Where the sun came shinin' through  
Like a beautiful bluebird  
I'd come flyin' back to you  
  
Well it kind of struck me funny  
Sort of made me smile  
After all these years on this old road  
How God could show me somethin'  
Never say a word  
There's so much that I don't know  
I've never seen that blue before  
Except in one place  
And she's not here with me right now

That's where she kept on climbin' lord

Neil Young,Danger Bird,/n/neil+young/danger+bird_20099336.html,"Danger bird, he flies alone  
And he rides the wind  
Back to his home  
Although his wings  
Have turned to stone  
  
And we used  
To be so calm  
Now I think  
About you  
All day long  
'Cause you've been  
With another man  
Here you are  
And here I am.  
  
That's the moment  
That he cracked  
Long ago in the  
Museum with his  
Friends.  
  
The jailbird takes the raps  
And he finds himself  
Spread-eagled on the tracks  
But the training that he learned  
Will get him nowhere fast.  
  
And I know we  
Should be free  
But freedom's just  
A prison to me  
'Cause I lied  
To keep it kind  
When I left you  
Far behind.  
  
With the rain  
Pounding on his  
Back he recalls  
The moment that  
He cracked long  
Ago in the museum  
With his friends.  
And like those  
Memories the rain  
Keeps pounding  
Down, down, down.  
  
And though these wings  
Have turned to stone  
I can fly fly fly away.  
Watch me fly above the city  
Like a shadow on the sky.  
Fly, fly, fly.

New Order,All Day Long,/n/new+order/all+day+long_20099831.html,"This is a song about an innocent  
Who died at the hands of a desperate man  
He trusted those who he thought he knew  
He trusted those who he looked up to  
I'll never forget the joy in his face  
He'd laugh and he'd cry and he'd ruin my place  
He'd drive me crazy, and he'd drive me wild  
I used to scream and shout all day long  
  
Now I hope you know this song  
Is about a child who now has gone  
And other children like him, too  
Abused and used by what adults do  
So don't tell me about politics  
Or all the problems of our economics  
When you can't look after what you can't own  
You scream and shout all day long

You weren't exactly falling over yourself  
When last I saw you

We'd get along like a house on fire  
Until you told me that I'd have to go  
How can someone like you work that slow  
  
Whatever you think of me  
You listen hard and I will make you see  
Whatever you think of me  
You listen hard and I will make you see  
  
I don't feel anything no more  
This state of grace is consuming me  
I'm not grown up and I am not a boy  
I feel no pain and I feel no joy  
Well I always thought  
We'd get along like a house on fire  
In those days when the sun was warm  
I ran in the street where I was born  
  
Whatever you think of me  
You listen hard and I will make you see  
Whatever you think of me  
You listen hard and I will make you see  
  
The streets are so empty at this time of night  
I'd rather walk on my own than fight  
In a world where I'd forgotten you

And all the lies of those thieves and crooks  
We sing intellectual songs of love  
From a stolen pen to a velvet glove.

Today the wind is blowing hard  
See that bird has flown too high  
Pretty soon it will be tired  
I spent a day all by myself  
A rich man without his wealth  
Sometimes I get it wrong  
But I'm not the only one  
  
The afternoon was very clear  
The sun was beating down on me  
I got thirsty for a beer  
That I had to go to sea  
The sea was very rough  
It made me feel sick  
But I like that kind of stuff  
It beats arithmetic  
  
I don't want the world to change

Just give me one more wish  
I can't get enough of this  
When it gets to be alive  
And not just still survive  
To hit and not to miss  
I can't get enough of this  
  
The early evening mist  
Looked beautiful to me  
Was sweeter than a kiss  
I wish you all could see  
I'm a long long way from home  
But this photograph of you  
Even though it's monochrome  
Tells me what I should do  
So I got up on my feet  
And I knew it would be alright  
For my clothes were looking beat  
In the middle of the night  
  
I don't want the world to change  
I like the way it is  
Just give me one more wish  
I can't get enough of this  
When it gets to be alive  
And not just still survive  
To hit and not to miss  
I can't get enough of this  
  
I don't want the world to change  
I like the way it is  
Just give me one more wish

Like a bird of doom  
As it shifts and cracks  
Where secrets lie in the border fires,  
In the humming wires  
Hey man, you know  
You're never coming back  
Past the square, past the bridge,  
Past the mills, past the stacks  
On a gathering storm comes  
A tall handsome man  
In a dusty black coat with  
A red right hand  
  
He'll wrap you in his arms,  
Tell you that you've been a good boy  
He'll rekindle all the dreams  
It took you a lifetime to destroy  
He'll reach deep into the hole,  
Heal your shrinking soul

He'll get you some  
You ain't got no car? He'll get you one

Through the ghettos and the barrio

Stacks of green paper in his  
Red right hand

You'll see him in your dreams  
He'll appear out of nowhere but  
He ain't what he seems

On the tv screen  
And hey buddy, I'm warning  
You to turn it off  
He's a ghost, he's a god,  
He's a man, he's a guru  
You're one microscopic cog  
In his catastrophic plan  
Designed and directed by  
His red right hand

Extra verse from dj Spooky Remix (From Scream 2 Soundtrack):  
He'll extend his hand, real slowly for a shake  
You'll see it coming toward you, real slowly for a shake  
(Grabbing at your peril buddy?) cause you know you ain't  
Getting near much as he will take.  
  
He's a...  
  
He's mumbling words you can't understand  
He's mumbling word behind his red right hand.

Now it's too late to tell you  
  
I miss you

So, so, I do  
So, so, I do

I miss you so much  
God knows I do  
I miss you so much  
I miss you so much  
  
If there was some way, you know I would  
I'd do it today, I wish I could  
I call out your name, it does no good

I wanna get to know you  
I really wanna fuck you, baby  
One dose of my lovin'  
I'm simply going to drive you crazy  
  
I wanna be your lover  
I wanna get to know you, baby  
One dose of my lovin'  
I'm really gonna drive you crazy  
  
[Young Buc]  
I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes  
Swingin' them hips when you pass  
I'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby  
Jump on this Harley  
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley  
Sip some Bacardi  
Then go pull up at the afterparty  
I think we make a perfect couple  
But you think I'm trouble  
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number  
She got me feeling like ""maybe she the wrong woman""  
Think I'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'  
Your toes painted hair fixed all the time  
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine  
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you  
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do  
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long  
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong  
Before I head home  
I'm'a stop at your house and blow the horn  
If you come outside you know it's on (holla at your boy)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Lloyd Banks]  
Bitches be frustrated with the baller  
Wonder why I don't call her  
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her  
It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her  
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more  
She loves it when I'm in town  
Hate it when I'm not around  
I get her and wear down  
Next door neighbors hear the sound  
Pictures hittin' the ground  
Just enough to hold us down  
I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round  
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy  
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady  
I admit I fell in love with her frame  
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name  
Her panties wet over fame  
Fall in love with my chain  
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain  
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only  
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[50 Cent]  
(Yeah) What would fuck me up more  
Watching her lick her lips  
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man  
I sweet talking her if she like  
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right  
Look I'm legit now used to break laws  
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours  
Big house big Benz girl it yours  
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws  
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you  
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal  
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you  
Cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you  
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me  
Put my tounge on you you put your tounge on me  
Let me ride on you and you can ride on  
We can do it all the night  
We can have a balla tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I wanna get to know you  
I wanna get to know you, baby  
One dose of my lovin'  
I'm simply gonna drive you, crazy  
  
I wanna be your lover  
I wanna get to know you, lady  
One dose of my lovin'  
I'm really gonna drive you, crazy

I wanna be your lover  
I really understand you, baby  
I want to be your lover  
I really understand you, baby, baby, baby, baby.

Sign up, it's recruiting time  
Big wigs with a suit and tie  
And them big things got two inside  
Fuck worn with these ho niggas  
Don't do coke I don't blow nigga  
I don't tell niggas I show niggas  
And it's never less than like 4 niggas  
4 wings and some french fries  
Hot sauce and ketchup nigga  
He telling and he hiding but real niggas will still catch a nigga  
I cop Raris, don't test drive em  
Home theaters, can't best buy em  
These niggas that I roll with don't let a single thing get by em  
King pins and them drug lords  
Chi-town no gun lords  
Broke bitches that talk shit, now them the bitches I stunt for  
Malcom X daughter came at me  
Looking niggas ain't happy  
Rolled out with some Latin Kings and some eses and them plain khakis  
Smack bitches, no smack cam  
Whole fist, no back hand  
Pop pussy on a hand stand, they sucking dick like a band camp  
Call Web and then call Nitty  
Queens niggas in it's all hoodies  
Kidnapping and then rob niggas  
Call D-rock for a biggie  
Pussy ass lil rap niggas  
I fucked with real trap niggas  
Pop star, icon but I send niggas come snatch niggas  
I'm with ebk, you on ebt  
Got a black nine, call it bet  
School niggas get a ged  
And I tease niggas make em B. E. G  
Got a money fetish, imma fly to Venice  
Got a big house I can play some tennis  
Lil herb, what's good  
I'm a bad bitch and I fuck good

When it's drama time  
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin  
Leave his loved ones all traumatized  
One-fifty I'm really wit' it  
I'll drop his ass and then forget it  
I'm the man round my side of town  
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it

I'm a young nigga I be getting money  
Take your bitch from you  
And these niggas get no respect  
I'mma stay 100 till I'm 6 under  
Matter fact I gotta keep it 150  
For every nigga that's gon come with me  
I'm on rock block with a new semi and a blue Bentley and do 160  
Smoke a lot a of weed  
Like fuck gimmicks, put a dutch in me  
Got a 40 on me, I don't trust any  
And if any nigga ever try to end me  
I'mma die shooting praying God forgive me  
You too busy hating you can't get no paper, why are ya'll so silly?  
Straight killers I can call so many  
I don't love no bitches but my mom, my sister, my gun and Nicki  
I'm in Hollywood came from Kingston Food  
Shorties standing in the streets with tools  
Where I'm from we don't play no games  
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news  
Where I hang we don't say no names  
If you talk to cop I stay away from you  
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations  
You'll be out the station in a day or two  
Dedication and a little patience  
Leave the domination on my way to greatness  
Don't put yourself up in a situation  
Putting my relations in your conversations  
Shoot a opposition with no hesitation  
You get my position nigga better take it  
Know some young bulls from a while back tryna leave the game but they never
made it  
I got old shit, killing your shit  
On a couple tracks I just never played it  
Pussy nigga you don't want war I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis

This is not an exit  
This has begun

'Bout how men and women ought to live apart  
And how a promise never made can not be broken  
And can never break your heart  
  
When suddenly from out of nowhere,  
A little girl came dancing 'cross the floor,  
And all her crinolines were billowing  
Beneath the skirt of calico that she wore.  
Oh what a joy fell on the honored guests  
As each of them was drawn inside her dream,  
And they laughed and clapped and stomped their feet  
And hollered at her ""dance little jean""  
  
Dance, little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people you love, stood up and said ""I do""  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had  
Was answered today  
Your mama's marrying your dad  
  
Well, my cynical heart just melted  
'Cause I knew what this get together meant  
How it ended year of tears and sad confusion  
That the little girl had spent.  
Well they told the band to pack it up  
About the time the couple cut the cake,  
But we played as long as they stayed  
For love and laughs and little jeanie's sake.

The night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole  
Said that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to go  
  
Why aren't you at the harvest ball with some sweet young gal  
You just sit like a bump on the log and call that fish your pal  
  
Well, I told him I was an orphan lived here all alone  
But many people have often tried to catch and take me home  
They never caught me  
  
Thought that I was a hiding, call this log my home  
But the fish and the moon and a sweet young gal  
All want me for their own

I want to show you, show you that good life baby  
You got my heartbeat, beating inside me lately  
I'm watching your lips move, can't hear a word you're saying  
Cause I want to do things, do things that drive you crazy

Do you feel like it's going the right way?  
Do you know what you're doing inside me?  
If you want that then bring that fire baby  
Yeah you got me, I'm dreaming about it  
If you like that then we can go round it  
If you need that then tell me right now  
Baby cause I wanna know

If this is the last night

Let's go to a place, we'll never be lonely  
Oh I need you, I need you to hold me

I call your name  
A lamentation I sigh  
Again and again  
  
Spiritual eclipse  
The gateways are closed for me to seek  
  
The night  
A veil of stars, watching  
My shadow is born from light  
The light of the eye, in darkness  
  
Over troubled waters memories soar  
Endlessly, searching night and day  
The moonlight caresses a lonely hill  
With the calmness of a whisper  
  
I wear a naked soul  
A blank face in the streaming water  
It is cold in here  
Frost scar my coat with dust  
  
Eyes attach to your mute portrait  
We spoke only through thoughts  
Together we gazed, awaited  
Hours brought thirst and the rising sun  
  
Sun birds leave their dark recesses  
Shadows gild the archways  
  
Do not turn your face towards me  
Confronting me with my loneliness  
You are in a forest unknown  
The secret orchard  
And your voice is vast and achromatic  
But still so precious  
  
Lullaby of the crescent moon took you  
Mesmerized, its kaleidoscopic face  
Granted you a hollow stare  
Another soul within the divine herd  
  
I have kept it  
The amaranth symbol  
Hidden inside the golden shrine  
Until we rejoice in the meadow  
Of the end  
When we both walk the shadows  
It will set ablaze and vanish  
Black rose immortal  
  
It is getting dark again  
Dusk shuffle across the fields  
The evening trees moan as if they knew  
At night I always dream of you

Their scorn behind your back

No trace of reverence left  
Immemorial fire in their eyes  
  
I would perish at the given signal  
At the slightest touch from my soul

Dripping sin  
Decision in stalemate  
Dare to feel death at hand  
Surprised me with its voice  
Through the forest came the morn  
  
Across the leafy pathway  
Their deeds smeared in blood  
For all to behold  
The council of the cross  
Must have sensed my coming  
The pest through the air  
With despise for squalor  
Lashing out at the poor  
  
I turned away my eyes  
In pallor escape from the end  
Fading time to leave from here  
And less to fulfill my task  
She would be safe and firm  
Nothing of this is in vain  
Taken away from stifling grace  
And saved from the past

In my bedroom

The wind and the rain smell of oil and octane  
Mixed with stale gasoline

It'll make a mess like you wouldn't believe  
Tie my handlebars to the stars so I stay on track (so I stay on track)

Walking down by the bay  
On the shore,  
Staring up at the stars, that aren't there anymore  
I was feeling the night grow old  
And you were looking so cold  
So like an introvert  
I drew my over shirt  
Around my arms and began, to shiver violently before  
You happened to look  
And see the tunnels all around me  
Running into the dark  
Underground  
All the subways around, create a great sound  
To my motion fatigue  
Farewell

You can hear the waves in underwater caves  
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home  
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?  
Only time, only time  
  
Can you believe that the crew has gone  
And wouldn't let me sign on?  
All my islands have sunk  
In the deep,  
And I can hardly relax or even oversleep  
But I feel more with your hand  
In mine  
When we walk on the shore line  
I guess we'll never know, why sparrows love the snow  
We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow  
  
So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?

Gently to the ground  
The temperature drops

Inertia must be a con  
Cause the cold wind blows at precise rates  
When I've got my ice skates on  
  
If all the roads  
Were paved with ice that wouldn't thaw or crack  
I could skate from Maine to Nebraska  
Then on to Alaska and back

Rivulets flow from your eyes  
Paint runs from your mouth  
Like a waterfall  
And your lungs crystallize

I'll brave glaciers and frozen lakes  
And that's just the tip of the iceberg  
I'll do whatever it takes  
To change  
  
Farewell powdery paradise

Fingers failed us before they froze  
Frostbite bit down on all our toes

So we snuggle close in the darkness  
And keep each other so warm

And many times confused

And certainly misused

I'm just weary to my bones  
Still, you don't expect to be  
Bright and bon vivant  
So far away from home, so far away from home  
  
And I don't know a soul who's not been battered  
I don't have a friend who feels at ease  
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered  
Or driven to it's knees  
But it's all right, it's all right  
We've lived so well so long  
Still, when I think of the road  
We're traveling on  
I wonder what's gone wrong  
I can't help it, I wonder what's gone wrong  
  
And I dreamed I was dying  
I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly  
And looking back down at me  
Smiled reassuringly  
And I dreamed I was flying  
And high up above my eyes could clearly see  
The Statue of Liberty  
Sailing away to sea  
And I dreamed I was flying  
  
We come on the ship they call the Mayflower  
We come on the ship that sailed the moon  
We come in the age's most uncertain hour  
And sing an American tune  
But it's all right, it's all right  
You can't be forever blessed  
Still, tomorrow's going to be another working day  
And I'm trying to get some rest  
That's all I'm trying to get some rest

Emerging from a dream, the dream returns  
How the heart approaches what it yearns

Headlights slide past the moon  
A bone-weary traveler that  
Waits by the side of the road  
Where's he going?  
  
In a dream we are lying on the top of a hill  
And headlights slide past the moon  
I roll in your arms  
And your voice is the heat of the night  
I'm on fire  
  
In a phone booth  
In some local bar and grill  
Rehearsing what I'll say, my coin returns  
How the heart approaches what it yearns

Asleep with the night,  
And her hair, in a fine mist  
Floats on my pillow,  
Reflecting the glow  
Of the winter moonlight.  
She is soft, she is warm,  
But my heart remains heavy,  
And I watch as her breasts  
Gently rise, gently fall,  
For I know with the first light of dawn  
I'll be leaving,  
And tonight will be  
All I have left to recall.  
Oh, what have I done,  
Why have I done it,  
I've committed a crime,  
I've broken the law.  
For twenty-five dollars  
And pieces of silver,  
I held up and robbed  
A hard liquor store.  
My life seems unreal,  
My crime an illusion,  
A scene badly written  
In which I must play.  
Yet I know as I gaze  
At my young love beside me,  
The morning is just a few hours away.

Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
Saying hello to men friends  
Smiling across a friend's friends  
Ordering drinks at the bar

You look first, then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
We'll stand around forever  
Regardless of time or weather  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
Looking for love, and getting  
Nothing that's worth regretting  
But wondering why we travel so far  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first, then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
To speak is a sin

I'm there again

Better than before  
Then I feel you touch me

Before you start

Maybe it's a habit  
Maybe it's a sin  
But I find out  
When I try it on  
It crawls beneath my skin  
Once it gets inside me  
It won't go

I want a lover

Do I have to?

Just to watch you sleep, hear each breath you take.  
When the morning lights your face,  
I just want to hold you, and forget the day.  
I live and breathe your every touch  
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me that much?  
  
When you look at me across the crowded room,  
Suddenly I want to be alone with you.  
I hang on every word that leaves your lips,  
Anticipate the moment when I feel your kiss.  
Enough of you is not enough.  
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me that much?  
  
For so long, I've been trying to believe,  
That someday, you'll fall as deep as me.  
But it's just not there, love isn't always fair.  
  
Would you want the best for me,  
And I hope I find the kind of love you can't feel for me.  
Could you find it in your heart,  
To end this thing right now before it's gone too far  
Let me go and give me up  
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me that much?  
Do you love me that much?

For barbecue parties on blood red sands I want you  
Caught in the struggle tight on the rod I want you

Staring at the shape of things

Overloaded with everything we said

A shattering of shop windows  
The bomb in the baby carriage

Well later on that day this guy came to me  
With a scrap of paper in his hand  
He said 'Hey buddy can you sign your name for me?'  
I said 'Why, do I owe you money?' He said 'No'  
I said 'Listen pal do I know you? Have we ever met?  
Why do you want my name on this little piece of paper?  
  
He said 'I love you,  
I don't know you but I love you,  
Like my brother I love you,  
Put your arms around me 'cause I love you'  
  
I said 'Hey let's not rush things  
  
You can wear my hat,  
You can have my coat,  
You can take my shirt  
Cause I don't need it.  
You can wear my shoes,

But how can I avoid the stress?

As each foot hits a stepping stone  
The music soothes and calms your mood

A single cloud within a storm  
Descends and leaves behind a form  
Someone that you knew appears in front of you  
A woman's figure, rain-cloud-born  
  
She blinks but doesn't see you yet  
She shivers and is soaking wet  
You cross the sand and take her hand  
A lifetime passed since last you met  
  
Centuries now fall away  
(expand the years) ?? Since yesterday  
When you were young and in the sun  
You let your woman slip away  
  
You take the hands that you have missed  
And kiss the lips you haven't kissed  
For many years  
Taste the tears

Pink Floyd,High Hopes,/p/pink+floyd/high+hopes_20108697.html,"Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young  
In a world of magnets and miracles  
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary  
The ringing of the division bell had begun  
  
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway  
Do they still meet there by the Cut  
  
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps  
Running before times took our dreams away  
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground  
To a life consumed by slow decay  
  
The grass was greener  
The light was brighter  
When friends surrounded  
The nights of wonder  
  
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us  
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side  
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again  
Dragged by the force of some inner tide  
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled  
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world  
  
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition  
There's a hunger still unsatisfied  
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon  
Though down this road we've been so many times  
  
The grass was greener  
The light was brighter  
The taste was sweeter  
The nights of wonder  
With friends surrounded  
The dawn mist glowing  
The water flowing  
The endless river  
  
Forever and ever

With a brick on the sand.  
Ridin' a wave  
In the wake of an old sedan.  
  
Sleepin' alone in the  
Drone of the darkness,  
Scratched by the sand that  
Fell from my love,  
Deep in my dreams and I  
Still hear her callin'  
""If you're alone,  
I'll come home.""  
  
Backward and homebound,  
The pigeon, the dove,  
Gone with the wind  
And the rain, on an airplane.  
Owning a home  
With no silver spoon,  
I'm drinking champagne  
Like a good tycoon.  
  
Sooner than wait for  
A break in the weather,  
I'll gather my far-flung  
Thoughts together.  
Speeding away  
On the wind to a new day.  
And if you're alone  
I'll come home.  
  
And I pause for a while  
By a country style  
And listen to the things they say.  
Diggin' for gold  
With a hoe in my hand.  
Open a book  
Take a look at the way things stand.  
  
And you're leading me down  
To the place by the sea.  
I hear your soft voice  
Calling to me.  
Making a date for  
Later by phone

If you negotiate the minefield in the drive  
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes  
And if you make it past the shotgun in the hall,  
Dial the combination, open the priest hole  
And if I'm in I'll tell you what's behind the wall.  
  
There's a kid who had a big hallucination  
Making love to girls in magazines.  
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith.  
Could anybody love him  
Or is it just a crazy dream?  
  
And if I show you my dark side  
Will you still hold me tonight?  
And if I open my heart to you  
And show you my weak side  
What would you do?  
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?  
Would you take the children away  
And leave me alone?  
And smile in reassurance  
As you whisper down the phone?  
Would you send me packing?  
Or would you take me home?  
  
Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings,  
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down.  
I held the blade in trembling hands  
Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang  
I never had the nerve to make the final cut.

You will know the difference  
When I touch ya  
  
Some people are so phony  
Nosey 'cause they lonely  
Aren't you sick of the same thing?  
They say so and so is dating  
Love you or they hatin'  
And it doesn't even matter anyway  
Cause were here tonight  
If you smile then that

Just remember baby

Move your bones  
Just remember

If you give that chance  
To be your man(x2)  
  
Maybe we'll fly the night away

Try  
  
I'm lookin' for a way to become  
The person that I dreamt of when I was sixteen

Ooh, baby, it ain't enough for what it may seem

All of those who ride the rapids  
Have a message they must tell  
There's a joy in being lost in something

And though the current takes you places  
Where you learn to lose control  
If you think you're going under

Proclaimers,Women And Wine,/p/proclaimers/women+and+wine_21057571.html,"A hundred years ago  
I thought happiness was ice cream and football.  
But time went by so fast  
Till I couldn't see their attractions at all.  
I looked around for other pleasures.  
The old man had shown the way then.  
Just in time I found women and wine.  
  
I marvelled at the way that they united men  
For the working and middle and upper classes.  
You didn't need any brains  
Just a taste for booze and a eye for lassies.  
I'm not basking in reflected glory  
But open any book and I think you'll find that  
The greatest men of all time  
Loved women and wine  
Or men and wine.  
  
Ah, they'll be the death of you  
If something else doesn't get you first.  
  
Well I'm older now  
And have to take my pleasures in moderation.  
Least that's what it says here in this guide to  
Declining years in declining nations.  
But just 'cause I've slowed up a bit  
Doesn't mean I can't cheer from the touchline.  
I hope sons of mine  
Spend lots of time  
On women and wine,  
Women and wine.

Siphoning out your cash, seein' the door, the flash

You motherfuckin' right, wantin' this shit every night  
Finish up, I hold her tight, wearin' feelings on my sleeve  
Even when I had to leave, cooler than the evening breeze  
Do you believe?  
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""  
  
The Division One leader, in the rebound with numerous shorties, off the post  
Goin' coast to coast, she on the hardwood, sub, I'm out the game  
She sayin', ""Nah, he good"", I mean  
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""  
  
For no amount of dough, franchise this man  
Give him all the things you can  
Think long-term plans, he be bringin' in the fans  
Front-page magazine, listen to this lady scream:  
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

She sayin'  
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

And the famous hall inevitably will make a call  
Hangin' memorabilia from your walls  
This is why you can't trade me  
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""  
  
You can put your money on a sure thing  
Certain profits will they bring  
Ceremonies are the ringer, in the White House thing  
Clear your mantle, the trophies I bring  
Do you wanna trade?  
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""  
  
Cause in the end as a teammate  
You're lookin' for a back shoot, and go-to ball  
Leaves it all on the floor, always lookin' to score  
Pep-talks in the locker-room  
This is why you sing this tune  
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""  
  
And injuries can't make me sit, I ball till you get out  
Hook off, no di-doubt, and all like get out  
I train for the pressure and come out fresher  
Equipped for the game, you know my name  
It makes me better  
A cheer, for the whole team, let's go, for the whole thing  
The ballad that you're holding, MVP voting  
And I, represent the sentiment, you're emoting  
As you say  
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""  
  
The physical ability, with mental capability  
Legitimately places me inside of your vicinity  
And I ain't really seein' me vacatin' this community  
I'm stayin' here  
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""  
  
I'm glad that you feel this way  
Here's where I like to play  
I need to hear it everyday, they cheer for me, say, ""Ole""

Queen,Is This The World We Created?,/q/queen/is+this+the+world+we+created_20112725.html,"Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed  
Take a look at all the suffering we breed  
So many lonely faces scattered all around  
Searching for what they need  
  
Is this the world we created?  
What did we do it for  
Is this the world we invaded  
Against the law  
So it seems in the end  
Is this what we're all living for today  
The world that we created  
  
You know that everyday a helpless child is born  
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home  
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne  
Waiting for life to go by  
  
Wooh, is this the world we created?  
We made it all our own  
Is this the world we devastated, right to the bone  
If there's a God in the sky looking down  
What can he think of what we've done  
To the world that he created

And I had to make him pay

Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire  
Don't believe what your grand-daddy said  
  
She was my lover  
It was a shame that she died  
But the constitution's right on my side  
'Cause I caught my lover in the neighbour's bed  
I got retribution  
Filled 'em all full of lead  
  
I've been told it's the fashion  
To let me on the streets again  
It's nothing but a crime of passion  
And I'm not to blame  
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire  
You need a weapon like a hole in the head  
Put out the fire, put out the fire, baby put out the fire  
And let your sons and daughters sleep sound in their beds  
  
You know a gun never killed nobody  
You can ask anyone  
People get shot by people  
People with guns  
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire  
You need a gun like a hole in the head  
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire

Gives cause for apprehension  
With speed and new invention  
And things like third dimension  
  
Yet we get a trifle weary  
With Mr. Einstein's theory  
So we must get down to earth at times  
Relax relieve the tension  
And no matter what the progress  
Or what may yet be proved  
The simple facts of life are such  
They cannot be removed  
  
You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss,  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by  
  
And when two lovers woo  
They still say, ""I love you""  
On that you can rely  
No matter what the future brings  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
Well, it's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die

And I agreed because I already knew this  
Now you should want to flex, cause I'm in full effect  
Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set  
You've been begging and dying for somebody's rhyming to set you free  
For God so loved the world he gave to me  
I'm coolin teaching those needing schoolin  
The mic, this mic in my hand, I'm rulin  
So prepare your mind for my lifeline  
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness  
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water  
And dive into the wrath of my madness

Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way  
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way  
Some MC's have gold and African vein  
And using each other to compete with  
Their subjects I pity because their rhymes are not witty like mine  
To write a rhyme so delicious you can eat it  
There are those who like my taste, but don't consider biting  
There's penalties for those who don't do writing, just be reciting  
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking  
It's not my fault your thoughts are shrinking  
while mine are growing, yes you know like all the woman inside of me  
Despite what you do or say, and even in spite of me  
Brothers, catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks  
Dying to have a lover of my likeness  
So release all your shyness, call me ""Your highness""  
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness

And everlasting are the words that I bring  
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey  
And music is made by Mark the 45 King  
You tremble for my treble, you're begging for the bass  
The voice is too vicious, the same as the pace  
The crowds, they love me, they give only hugs  
The shrinked-to-fit buttonflies fit quite snug  
As a bug, you know why? Because I'm bugging  
Of the beats that DJ Mark is loving  
So plex on the sounds that I'm pumping  
I'm jumping with the energy to turn your mind to gladness  
Come on, just get into it, don't lie and say you've been through it  
Feel the wrath of my madness

I scene is mine cause I took it  
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun  
Don't step up in my face, you don't want to feel the taste  
Don't try and play me out, cause I am not the one  
Brothers on my brastrap, sisters clocking my sound, why?  
Because they want to be down with the  
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command  
I supply the concept for you to understand  
For those who want to bite, don't make me have to fuss  
The only thing you get is the gluteous maximus  
Suckers on the tip, you're loving me, you're leaving me  
You wish that one day you could have this  
Come on, you know the time, just be thankful for the rhyme  
And get up on the wrath of my madness

Of the Father up above  
But only one startled the way

Without your holy light  
They would still be searching

No, you can't get this at home  
They woke up in each other's arms  
And that's where they spent the rest of the weekend  
  
They love their kids and their house  
And that dog in the yard  
Oh and their neighbors for the most part  
They love each other but it's hard to be lovers  
When life gets in the way  
Sometimes love needs a holiday  
  
Room service dinner with candles and wine  
A night with no homework and no baby crying  
They hold each other like they used to do  
He whispers, ""Girl, I've missed you""  
  
They love their kids and their house  
And that dog in the yard  
Oh and their neighbors for the most part

Love needs a holiday

Just shut out the rest of the world

Can't stop now, I've travelled so far, to change this lonely life  
I want to know what love is, I want you to show me

I'm gonna take a little time, a little time to look around me  
I've got nowhere left to hide, it looks like love has finally found me

Religious Music,Angels Among Us,/r/religious+music/angels+among+us_20887180.html,"I was walking home from school on a cold winter day  
Took a shortcut through the woods, and I lost my way  
It was getting late, and I was scared and alone  
Then a kind old man took my hand and led me home.  
  
Mama couldn't see him  
But he was standing there  
And I knew in my heart  
He was the answer to my prayers.  
  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
When life held troubled times, and had me down on my knees  
There's always been someone there to come along and comfort me  
A kind word from a stranger, to lend a helping hand  
A phone call from a friend, just to say I understand  
  
And ain't it kind of funny that at the dark end of the road  
Someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope.  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
They wear so many faces  
Show up in the strangest places  
To guide us with their mercy  
In our time of need.  
  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.

A fire that's built on fear and frustration  
One man's heaven is another man's hell  
Every story has got two sides to tell  
Don't let anybody pull you under

They criticize when they can't relate  
Some people don't love, they just love to hate  
  
Some people can hardly wait  
To tear down what you create  
Cause some people don't love, they just love to hate

Stare at myself in the mirror  
Take me apart, piece by piece  
Sorrow decrease, pressure release  
I put in work  
Did more than called upon, more than deserved  
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)  
But it taught me before a decision ask this question first:  
  
[Chorus]  
Who am I living for?  
Is this my limit, can I endure some more?  
Chances are given, question existing  
Who am I living for?  
Is this my limit, can I endure some more?  
Chances are given, question existing  
  
Take off my cool  
Show them that under here I'm just like you  
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool  
Or a human with flaws?  
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause  
Take the abuse  
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose  
It's entertainment, is that an excuse? (No)  
But the question that lingers whether win or lose:  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dear diary  
It's Robyn  
Entertaining is something I do for a living  
It's not who I am  
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal  
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt, I think I suck sometimes  
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good  
(Ooo, yeah)  
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst 'cause I have to always keep my guard up  
I don't know who to trust, I don't know who wants to date me for who I am  
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am

I finally found the strength to face  
The pain you made me feel  
I always held my tongue  
And all the things you've done to me  
Are secrets to reveal  
  
I'll never let you do this to someone else

To play your wicked games  
With the mask you're wearing  
And now you gotta make amends  
For the demons in my head  
I'll nail you to the cross  
The cross I'm bearing  
  
You, you said you'd save my soul  
And sacrificed the innocence  
That I will never know  
Now it's time that you confess  
They say the devil doesn't rest  
Until the truth is told  
  
I'll never let you do this to someone else

You were God and I believed  
You made me kneel  
You made me feel  
Like it was all my fault  
But now I know it wasn't mine at all  
  
How dare you use my shame  
To play your wicked game  
You gotta make amends  
For the demons in my head

See the glory  
Of the royal scam  
  
By the blackened wall  
He does it all  
He thinks he's died and gone to heaven  
Now the tale is told  
By the old man back home  
He reads the letter  
How they are paid in gold  
Just to babble in the back room  
All night and waste their time  
And they wandered in  
From the city of St. John without a dime  
  
See the glory  
Of the royal scam

Keep your eyes on the sky  
Put a dollar in the kitty

The water will change to cherry wine  
And the silver will turn to gold

Where people are rolling in the snow  
Far from the world we know  
  
Children we have it right here

It's perfection and grace  
It's the smile on my face

Sting,Never Coming Home,/s/sting/never+coming+home_20286779.html,"Well it's five in the morning and the light's already broken  
And the rainy streets are empty for nobody else has woken  
Yet you turn towards the window as he sleeps beneath the covers  
And you wonder what he's dreaming in his slumbers  
  
There's a clock upon the table and it's burning up the hour  
And you feel your life is shrinking like the petals of a flower  
As you creep towards the closet you're so careful not to wake him  
And you choose the cotton dress you bought last summer  
  
There's a time of indecision between the bedroom and the door  
But the part of you that knows that you can't take it any more  
There's the promise of the future in the creaking of the floor  
And you're torn if you should leave him with a number  
  
And in your imagination you're a thousand miles away  
Because too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So you write it in a letter all the things you couldn't say  
And you tell him that you're never coming home  
  
She starts running for the railway station praying that her calculation's
right  
And there's a train just waiting there to get her to the city before night  
A place to sleep a place to stay will get her through another day  
She'll take a job she'll find a friend she'll make a life that's better  
  
The passengers ignore her just a girl with an umbrella  
And there's nothing they can do for her, there's nothing they can tell her  
There's nothing they could ever say would change the way she feels today  
She'd live the life she'd always dreamed if he had only let her  
  
Now in her imagination she's a million miles away  
When too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So she wrote it in a letter all the things she couldn't say  
And she told him she was never coming home  
She told him she was never coming home  
  
I wake up in an empty bed a road drill hammers in my head  
I call her name there's no reply it's not like her to let me lie  
It's time for work it's time to go but something's different I don't know  
I need a cup of coffee I'll feel better  
  
I stumble to the bathroom door, her make up bag is on the floor  
It really is a mess this place it takes some time to shave my face  
I'm not really thinking straight she never lets me sleep this late  
I'm almost done and then I see the letter  
  
In his imagination she's a universe away  
Too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So she wrote it in a letter all things she couldn't say  
And she told him she was never coming home,  
She told him she was never coming home,  
She told him she was never coming home  
  
I'm gonna live my life  
And she told him she was never coming home

How cold is a heart  
When it's warmth that he seeks?  
You watch every night, you don't care what I do

Comes to pay her respects, but her mind is awhirl.  
When she finds the tomb empty, the stone had been rolled,  
Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold.  
When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight,  
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light.  
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill,  
In an almighty hurry, aye but she might catch him still.  
  
""Tell me where are ye going Lord, and why in such haste?""  
""Now don't hinder me woman, I've no time to waste!  
For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon,  
And I have to be there before daybreak.  
Oh I canna be missing, the lads'll expect me,  
Why else would the good Lord himself resurrect me?  
For nothing will stop me, I have to prevail,  
Through the teeth of this tempest, in the mouth of a gale,  
May the angels protect me if all else should fail,  
When the last ship sails.""  
  
Oh the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers,  
The noise at the end of the world in your ears,  
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea,  
And the last ship sails.  
  
It's a strange kind of beauty,  
It's cold and austere,  
And whatever it was that ye've done to be here,  
It's the sum of yer hopes yer despairs and yer fears,  
When the last ship sails.  
  
Well the first to arrive saw these signs in the east,  
Like that strange moving finger at Balthazar's Feast,  
Where they asked the advice of some wandering priest,  
And the sad ghosts of men whom they'd thought long deceased,  
And whatever got said, they'd be counted at least,  
When the last ship sails.  
  
Oh the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers,  
The noise at the end of the world in your ears,  
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea,  
And the last ship sails.  
  
And whatever you'd promised, whatever you've done,  
And whatever the station in life you've become.  
In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son,  
And whatever the weave of this life that you've spun,  
On the Earth or in Heaven or under the Sun,  
When the last ship sails.

Lead Vocals by James Young  
  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery they bring  
To the music in their story  
  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery they bring  
To the lands of ancient glory  
  
In the year of the Lords  
The message came from above  
The heavens opened with their mighty sound  
that shook the people in the town  
  
And so we came from everywhere  
The young and old the rich and poor  
To hear the legend of the magic ring  
and of the powers it could bring, they sing  
  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery they bring  
To the music in their story  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery it brings  
May we someday wear its glory  
  
And now the message is clear  
For I became a Lord this year  
And though the legend was pure fantasy  
We still need the hope it brings, so let's sing  
  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To believe is a wonderous thing  
May we always sing their glory  
  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery they bring  
To the promise of their story

A winged horse guides his way  
Oracle of the ancient midnight  
Calls forth everlasting pain  
  
And I know, yes I know  
He was a man of miracles  
Riding golden meteorites  
Ruler of distant galaxies  
Born of the northern lights  
Of the northern lights  
  
Sorcerer of the dark moon  
Who dare incur his rage?  
First child of the scorpion  
Prophet of the crystal age

Riding golden meteorites  
Ruler of distant galaxies  
Born of the northern lights

Styx,The Grand Illusion,/s/styx/the+grand+illusion_20132977.html,"Welcome to the Grand illusion  
Come on in and see what's happening  
Pay the price, get your tickets for the show  
The stage is set, the band starts playing  
Suddenly your heart is pounding  
Wishing secretly you were a star.  
  
But don't be fooled by the radio  
The TV or the magazines  
They show you photographs of how your life should be  
But they're just someone else's fantasy  
So if you think your life is complete confusion  
Because you never win the game  
Just remember that it's a Grand illusion  
And deep inside we're all the same.  
We're all the same  
  
So if you think your life is complete confusion  
Because your neighbors got it made  
Just remember that it's a Grand illusion  
And deep inside we're all the same.  
We're all the same  
  
America spells competition, join us in our blind ambition  
Get yourself a brand new motor car  
Someday soon we'll stop to ponder what on Earth's this spell we're under  
We made the grade and still we wonder who the hell we are

Sometimes right now since I've left the pen  
I feel like I'm right back there again  
  
Sometimes I pray, waiting waiting for some bright holiday  
So I bought myself a gun and I'm right back right back where I'm from

My girlfriend said so, she's a little ho

The Broadways,I Hear Things Are Just As Bad Down In Lake Erie,/t/the+broadways/i+hear+things+are+just+as+bad+down+in+lake+erie_20526345.html,"Another ugly fucking stare  
Friendly faces seem so few and far between  
The older I get it seems I'm just a piece of shit  
To those even older than me  
Why am I so fucking bad?  
I've been to school ever since I was three  
And I'm part of a happy family  
Well my agenda might not be the same as yours  
More to do with peace of mind and less to do with greed  
I don't live vicariously through my tv  
If I had a wish I'd do away with capitalist society  
I'd build a world where smiles and love are worth more than money  
And if this world blew up I'd finally get a decent night's sleep  
And every night I pray for sweet dreams and an h-bomb  
But my bomb didn't fall today  
Looked at the sky and prayed for metal rain  
Yesterday I stared out at the water, lawn chair in the sand all day  
And as the sun kissed the horizon and the day began to fade  
And people got into their cars and drove the fuck away  
And the sounds of modern industry drifted lazily into space  
But the fish are still dead in the water  
And the machine starts up again at 8  
And when the by-products of progress are human lives instead of fish  
It will be too late to realize our mistakes  
Our quest for progress has become so fucking absurd  
Thank god for juicers vcrs and quisinarts  
Meanwhile people are still fucking blind  
Meanwhile we're all dying of aids  
O the neutron bomb is so fucking ingenious  
Kill a million people instantly but preserve their machines  
Erase a culture and a race  
But their fax machines are safe  
Just another fucking reason why I hate this fucking place  
The fish are fucking dead in the water  
And the ugly stares persist  
And I forgot how to smile  
Is it our culture, our species or just our sick state of mind  
That makes us so proficient in hate?  
Yeah we blew up japan and they bought our real estate  
And the indians never saw a dime  
We look out for number one so much that number two is dehumanized  
If you don't believe me then take a look out on the street  
Human fucking beings living in refrigerator boxes  
Begging assholes like you and me for money just to eat  
The fish are all dead in the water and the feelings are dead on the shore  
And the only dream I have is for an h-bomb to come  
And blow us fucking up  
So you don't have to hear me bitch anymore

Thin Lizzy,It's Getting Dangerous,/t/thin+lizzy/its+getting+dangerous_20136647.html,"The man finds himself alone for the first time in his life  
He's always got a problem, he's got to work it out wrong or right  
He's got to work it out, he's so lonely in the night  
He's got to work it all alone  
  
Now who in the world would believe that he's got another trick up his sleeve  
And who in the world wants to know which way should he go  
Which way should he turn? which way should he learn?  
Which day should he stop? which way to the top?  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
I still can recall when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
This living on his own has turned his heart to stone and it's all pain  
He sits out on his own and eats his heart out alone in the pouring rain  
Now who in the world would have know  
That just a few years ago his love could have grown and grown  
  
Through the rain, the sleet and snow  
But the rain, the sleet and snow chills the heart and kills the soul  
So the let the cold winds blow  
What he doesn't see he doesn't know  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
I remember it still, I always will when we were friends way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
He said, watch out for the danger  
He said, watch out  
  
The man is a winner for the first time in his life  
He looks a little thinner but he says hey that doesn't matter  
But if you look closely  
You'll see a cold smug self-satisfactory smile behind  
  
And now that he has won it doesn't matter how or which way it was done  
Now that he's in control, revenge is in his heart and soul  
The power is at his fingertips, vengeance is on his lips  
But the power he fought to control now has got him in it's grips  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
I remember it still, I always will when we were friends way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
But now we're all grown up and we're strangers  
You see, bit by bit, part by part, we slipped and slipped  
Till we'd grown apart and now we're strangers

Tim McGraw,Grown Men Don't Cry,/t/tim+mcgraw/grown+men+dont+cry_20137386.html,"I pulled into the shopping center  
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother  
Like ice cream melting, they embraced  
Years of bad decisions running down her face  
All morning I'd been thinking my life's so hard  
And they wore everything they owned, living in a car  
I wanted to tell them it would be ok  
But I just got in my Suburban, and I, I drove away  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry  
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry  
  
Keep having this dream about my old man  
I'm ten years old and he's holding my hand  
We're talking on the front porch watching the sun go down  
But it was just a dream, he was a slave to his job and he couldn't be around  
So many things I want to say to him  
I just placed a rose on his grave and I talked to the wind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm sitting here with my kids and my wife and everything that I hold dear in
my life  
We say Grace and thank the Lord, got so much to be thankful for  
Then its up the stairs and off to bed  
And my little girl says ""I haven't had my story yet""  
Everything weighing on my mind disappears, just like that  
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says, ""I love you dad""

Drug me 'round by my headband

With just my arrow and my hickory bow  
From a hundred yards don't you know

Shoes and dress that Alice wore  
So, I'm humming as I walk this house

Knowing in my heart that Texas had to be my home  
I fell in love with Texas I was happy I was free but Texas never fell in love
with me  
I found out my style just didn't suit the local squirrels  
I found out that I can't fit into a cowboy world  
I'm back in Indiana just as lonesome as can be Texas never fell in love with
me  
  
I bought myself a cowboy hat of course it didn't fit  
I bought myself a case of Coor's and I used to drink and sip  
I watch the cowgirls come and go Lord don't they love to play  
The one I wanted never came my way  
I found out my style...  
Texas never fell in love with me

Tom Waits,A Sweet Little Bullet From A Pretty Blue Gun,/t/tom+waits/a+sweet+little+bullet+from+a+pretty+blue+gun_20138791.html,"Well it's raining, it's pouring  
You didn't bring a sweater  
Nebraska'll never let you come back home  
  
Now on Hollywood and Vine  
By the Thrifty Mart sign  
Any night I'll be willin' to bet  
  
There's a young girl  
With sweet little dreams and pretty blue wishes  
Standin' there just gettin' all wet  
  
Now there's a place off the drag  
Called the Gilbert Hotel  
And there's a couple letters  
Burned out in the sign  
  
And it's better than a bus stop  
They do good business every time it rains  
For little girls with nothing in their jeans  
But pretty blue wishes and sweet little jeans  
  
And it's raining it's pouring  
The old man is snoring  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
I hear the sirens in the street  
All my dreams are made of chrome  
I have no way to get back home  
I'd rather die before I wake  
Like Marilyn Monroe  
And you could throw my dreams out in the street  
And let the rain make 'em grow  
  
Now the night clerk he got a club foot  
He's heard every hard luck story  
At least a hundred times or more  
  
He says: check out time is 10 am  
And that's just what it means  
Go on up the stairs  
With sweet little wishes and pretty blue dreams  
  
And it's raining it's pouring  
And Hollywood's just fine  
Swindle a little girl out of her dreams  
Another letter in the sign  
  
Now never trust a scarecrow wearin' shades after dark  
Be careful of that old bow tie he wears  
It takes a sweet little bullet from a pretty blue gun  
To put those scarlet ribbons in your hair  
  
No that ain't no cherry bomb  
Fourth of July's all done  
Just some fool playin' that second line  
From the barrel of a pretty blue gun

They fill my cup up in the cage  
It's nobody's business but mine when I'm low  
To hold yourself up is not a crime here you know  
At the end of the world  
  
I kick my foot at the lights  
I breathe it in all night  
There's a light on a canvas tree  
Money from home supporting me  
  
They pay me not to come home  
I won't eat crow  
Ill stay away  
And though all roads will not lead you home, my girl  
All roads lead to the end of the world  
  
And I sewed a little luck up in the hem of my gown  
The only way down from the gallows is to swing  
And I'll wear boots instead of high heels  
And the next stage that I am on, it will have wheels

You stopped and turned around, and lent you my hand  
You smiled though you were suffering, I didn't understand, then  
  
You broke into my heart, I saw your eyes and then I knew  
You broke into my heart, like the wind and rain that followed you  
You broke into my heart, had the Lord above forgotten you?  
You broke in from the start, and all my tears belong to you

Through ancient songs did the tale unfold  
They sang of diamonds that came from their mountains  
And loss of lives mining white man's gold  
  
I had to leave and go back to Manhattan  
Where all my stories are bought and sold  
I know the city would surely be saddened, if what I knew could be told  
  
It's been so long since I last heard your laughter  
So many letters and still no news

There's a hole in heaven where some sin slips through  
Close your eyes and dream real steady  
Maybe just a little will spill on you

At lonely Miss Lily hiding in the hall  
Lily's just praying for the trial to be over  
Rosy's just waitin' for the ax to fall  
Show me off on the way to town  
The sky's still shiny and the earth's still brown  
Tell the judge I'm ready for the vases  
Gonna dance in their faces  
When the guitar sounds  
  
It won't be long  
I won't be gone  
I've been leaning toward the shadows all along

Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

Carried the cross of my shame

I sing it for you.  
Like the words I have to bring  
I bring it for you.  
  
And in leather, lace and chains we stake our claim.  
Revolution once again  
No I won't, I won't wear it on my sleeve.  
I can see through this expression and you know I don't believe.  
Too old to be told, exactly who are you?  
Tonight, tomorrow's too late.  
  
And we love to wear a badge, a uniform  
And we love to fly a flag  
But I won't let others live in hell  
As we divide against each other  
And we fight amongst ourselves  
Too set in our ways to try to rearrange  
Too right to be wrong, in this rebel song  
Let the bells ring out  
Let the bells ring out  
Is there nothing left?  
Is there, is there nothing?  
Is there nothing left?  
Is honesty what you want?  
  
A generation without name, ripped and torn  
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain  
Nothing at all  
And if you can't help yourself  
Well take a look around you  
When others need your time  
You say it's time to go... it's your time.  
Angry words won't stop the fight  
Two wrongs won't make it right.  
A new heart is what I need.  
Oh, God make it bleed.  
Is there nothing left?

We see the sun go down in your eyes

You run like a river runs to the sea

A fire zone  
Where poets speak their heart  
Then bleed for it

In the hands of love  
You know his blood still cries  
From the ground

It runs like a river to the sea  
  
I don't believe in painted roses  
Or bleeding hearts  
While bullets rape the night of the merciful  
I'll see you again  
When the stars fall from the sky  
And the moon has turned red  
Over One Tree Hill

Run to the sea

And when it's raining  
Raining hard  
That's when the rain will

Caught you stealing something, my last thrill

Life's one big bed baby  
From the trash right on the street and anyone you meet  
Trying to make the first glance and I doubt you will last  
Caught you with your pants down fingers in the till

Someone came to rescue me, lit up like a christmas tree  
Tired of living on my own, someone came and take me home  
Sometimes, this jungle life is boring, pawing,  
Ready for a feast, someone kill the beast  
Outside, streets are teeming, breathing heavy,  
Ready to explode, my brother's heavy load,  
What you reap is what you sow

I never had no lovin' like I had in Alabama  
A man of my word ain't out to hurt nobody  
I'm just a M see to keep the boogie in the party

Tooth red main running through the vein

Call and you can't refuse it's refrain  
But you don't hear the real sirens song

The man who has heard its call can't leave a thing unseen  
If I should see him and he needs the warmth of a friend  
I'll try to help him for the short time he was in  
I won't be surprised when I wake and he's gone once again  
For he is a dreamer who follows the song of the wind  
Yes he is a dreamer who's heart sings a song of the wind

With a Thompson gun for hire, fighting to be done  
The deal was made in Denmark on a dark and stormy day  
So he set out for Biafra to join the bloody fray  
  
Through sixty-six and seven they fought the Congo war  
With their fingers on their triggers, knee-deep in gore  
For days and nights they battled the Bantu to their knees  
They killed to earn their living and to help out the Congolese  
  
Roland the Thompson gunner...  
  
His comrades fought beside him - Van Owen and the rest  
But of all the Thompson gunners, Roland was the best  
So the CIA decided they wanted Roland dead  
That son-of-a-bitch Van Owen blew off Roland's head  
  
Roland the headless Thompson gunner  
Norway's bravest son  
Time, time, time  
For another peaceful war  
But time stands still for Roland  
'Til he evens up the score  
They can still see his headless body stalking through the night  
In the muzzle flash of Roland's Thompson gun  
In the muzzle flash of Roland's Thompson gun  
  
Roland searched the continent for the man who'd done him in  
He found him in Mombassa in a barroom drinking gin  
Roland aimed his Thompson gun - he didn't say a word  
But he blew Van Owen's body from there to Johannesburg  
  
Roland the headless Thompson gunner...  
The eternal Thompson gunner  
still wandering through the night  
Now it's ten years later but he still keeps up the fight  
In Ireland, in Lebanon, in Palestine and Berkeley

Like a cold hearted women whiskey in my water  
And only one way out of a motel room  
Payments on the Cadillac and too many questions  
And old guitars that just won't stay in tune

It's all in how you handle them do's and don'ts  
A hillbilly boy is hard to convince wild and stubborn and not much sense

You better chow down, or it's gonna get cold

Just eat it, eat it

Just eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!  
Don't you make me repeat it!

It doesn't matter what you had for lunch  
  
Just eat it! Eat it!  
Eat it! Eat it!  
Eat it! Eat it!  
If it's getting cold, reheat it

And all the goyim say I'm pretty fly for a rabbi  
  
Meccha leccha hi, meccha hiney hiney ho  
  
Our temple's had a fair share of rabbis in the past  
But most of'em were nudniks and none of'em would last  
But our new guy's real kosher, I think he'll do the trick  
I tell ya, he's to die for - he really knows his shtick  
  
So how's by you? Have you seen this Jew?  
Reads the Torah, does his own accounting too  
Working' like a dog at the synagogue  
He's there all day, he's there all day  
  
Just say ""Vay is mir!"" and he'll kick into gear  
He'll bring you lots of cheer and maybe bagels with some shmeer  
Just grab your yarmulka and  
Hey! Hey! Do that Hebrew thing!  
  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
And all the goyim say I'm pretty fly (for a rabbi)  
  
He shops at discount stores, not just any will suffice  
He has to find a bargain 'cause he won't pay retail price  
He never acts meshugga and he's hardly a schlemiel  
But if you want to haggle, oy, he'll make you such a deal!  
  
People used to scoff, now they say ""Mazel tov!""  
He's such a macher 'cause he works his tuchis off  
Yeah, he keeps his cool and teaches shul  
What's not to like? What's not to like?  
  
Oh high holy days, you know he prays and prays  
And he never eats pastrami on white bread with mayonnaise  
Put on your yarmulka and  
Hey! Hey! Do that Hebrew thing!  
  
When he's doing a Bar Mitzvah, now that you shouldn't miss  
He'll always shlep on down for a wedding or a briss  
They say he's got a lot of chutzpah, he's really quite hhhhhip  
The parents pay the moyl and he gets to keep the tip!  
  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!

He's doin' well, I gotta kvell  
The yentas love him, even shicksas think he's swell  
Show up at his home, he says, ""Shalom!""  
And ""Have some cake-You want some cake?""  
  
Yeah he calls the shots, we really love him lots  
Oy gevalt, I'm so ferklempt that I could plotz!

Pleasant shudders shake their senses  
My warm momentum throws their stance.  
  
You'll feel me coming  
A new vibration  
From afar you'll see me  
I'm a sensation.  
  
I leave a trail of rooted people  
Mesmerized by just the sight,  
The few I touch are now disciples  
Love as one I am the light...  
  
Soon you'll see me can't you feel me  
I'm coming...  
Send your troubles dancing he knows the answer  
I'm coming...

Yo, man I'm just getting back from the tour, man  
What it be like, man?  
Yo, bust it, turn me up  
Somebody told me if you can make in New York City, man, you can  
make it anywhere else, man  
Somehow I believe that shhhh  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, what a night  
Late December, 1993 (what happened?)  
Who thought he would rule the industry?  
What an MC on the grind  
  
Yo, I ain't always have whips, I ain't always have yachts  
I ain't always have chips, I ain't always have rocks  
Matta fact I was a grimey little negro  
Who said if music didn't work, I'd sell diesel  
What cha'll thought, I wasn't raised in the projects?  
First of the month waitin for that PA check  
Lived on the first floor  
Were so poor that if you rung the buzzer the roaches would answer the door
(who is it?)  
I went from boy to man in one night  
When I saw my life flash like light from poltergeist  
What made it worse, I couldn't speak English  
But from his facial expressions, he wanted my Adidas  
So hurry up and come out and play  
I'll be damned if I leave bare-footed in this hallway  
And I got big plans, so beg your pardon  
Cause next year this time I'ma sell out the Garden  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yo, yo, I ain't gonna brag and boast and say I did it all  
But I'm the only rapper to play Carnegie Hall  
The first rap group, video cost a million  
First rapper to ever rep for the Haitians  
And sa fa say, na boolay  
Grammy night, we took 3 away  
22 million sold, I can't believe this  
There's still ain't a rapper alive who could achieve this  
But I ain't satisfied, when back to my home contemplating  
How could I become the next Quincy Jones?  
That's when Jerry hit me up on the horn and said  
""Clef, your on the cover of  
the cover of The Source by The Rolling Stones""  
No more struggling, good life we loving it  
You could live it too, if you only publish it  
So here we go, so what's the scenario?  
I own so many cars that I'm renting 'em for videos

One rainy day  
It was dark in the sky  
She turned and she said to him  
With grey in her eyes  
Go home again

Go back and repair your heart

And it trickled from his eyes

You not here, so you ain't really givin' a fuck  
But I swear, as long as I'm breathin', I'm hustlin'  
I'm thuggin', and this is the reason because I

If you see me in a suit and tie (in a suit and tie)  
Tell all my niggaz goodbye (tell my niggaz goodbye)  
Tell 'em that I'm on my wayyyyy (tell 'em I'm on my way man)  
Say a prayer for me and hug the kids (hug the kids)  
Tell God all of the shit I did (the shit I did)  
And how the kids looked up to me (cause they did look up to me nigga!)  
Yeahhhh  
  
Heyyy, holla if you feel my pain  
I been to hell and back, and I'm still the same  
The block hotter than flames, but we sell the 'caine  
Putti'n all kind of thangs in our baby's name  
Tell the hoes ""I'm rich bitch"" like my name Rick James  
I really ain't got shit, but I can't complain  
Cause L.T. got life, and Big Ju got fifty  
Jimmy did his ten and D doin his twenty  
Come get me, seems like it's no way out  
So when I say ""Dirty,"" you say ""South""  
Tryin' to put my hands on somethin', brush off my shoulders  
Buy up some land or somethin', get what they owe us  
You don't have a plan, you're nuttin' is what they told us  
Remember what the O.G.'s showed to the soldiers  
Gotta make it to heaven or die tryin' to get it  
The day dude fuck with Dre, I was feelin' like

Every time a day, count em' baby gogo  
  
You know how the drop be everything slow

And I was in and out of state just like Romo  
  
Lookin' out for them boys no homo  
Can't tell em what your drivin' that a no no  
I'm gonna tell you this but keep it on the low low

Nobody seems to understand that my brain ain't stable  
They got me out on the ledge  
feel like I'm falling off the edge it ain't no fable  
It's reality, feel like I'm on the offensive, they trying to tackle me  
That's why I keep popping fists  
So rather relative or stranger, better keep your distance  
I can't determine friend or foe so you in danger  
Chemical imbalances of the weed and cocaine, but it really  
Don't matter to society, a nigga that got no face and no name  
Deserving more, but I'ma mob until I ain't got nothing left  
And the only thing that's promised to me is more problems and death  
Cause there's some niggas looking for me and they might be near  
And if they kill me don't shed a tear, remember I'm not happy here  
Even still, got to keep my eyes on the prize  
Although my vision is blurry I'm losing life in a hurry  
Even my girlfriend don't understand, didn't want to  
Witness the wicked so please find yourself another man, haters feel me  
(Chorus - 2x)  
This is my liiiiiiiiife  
Surviving in the struggle, living so shife  
[Verse 2]  
My opposition and proposition is scheming for cash  
And if you bitches is scandalous, I get in that ass  
So let's reliviate the pressure  
Don't try to run it's guaranteed these slugs'll catch you  
Oh yeah, I keeps a problem solver  
A pistol grip, a automatic and revolver  
Check it, and I'ma handle up baby  
It's in my nature it's a must it ain't a maybe, peep game  
The feds taking pictures, and tapping my phones  
But if I catch you bitches snitching best believe me it's on  
I analyze of this realize and open fire on bitches  
And if I catch you bastards slipping I'm leaving bodies in ditches, huh  
I bet that ass can pass it  
Your life span it ain't long, you in a casket, check it  
Niggas rushing your ass, mob deep with ski masks  
Busting shots on the road trying to make your car crash, this is my life  
(Chorus - 2x)  
[Z-Ro]  
These boys be telling me they got love, giving me false-i-fied tapping, but  
I know they wouldn't give a fuck about me if there wasn't no money in rapping  
See I know they want to get rich off me understand, even if I was  
To die I still can talk they still put a mic in my hand  
For trying to copy my style of life, pretending like they from my block  
While I survive on willing to live while they depend on mom and pops  
Before you make your move, check yourself and giving me for the millions  
For the love of the struggle and just can't take it cause you not real  
You want to be dead, there's gone be a dentist to see  
When a nigga be scream and hollering I'm godfather  
But I guess it's just the menace in me, plus  
The only nigga that's skipping me from clicking is Herman Fisher  
Relocated the killers and gats and drinking and if and burning swishers  
Why they want to play with my life, they got families, nigga I don't  
The only thing between me and them hoes  
Is I'ma keep thugging they timid ass won't  
Will they mind they own god damn business and keep they self out of mine  
Because of a thin line, between handling business  
and boo yeah coward a nine baby

Z-Ro,Remember Me,/z/z+ro/remember+me_20713221.html,"Hell yeah nigga, ay yo  
  
[Z-Ro:]  
Remember me, when I use to write my rhymes in class  
At Dick Dall Middle School, all them niggaz would laugh  
Telling me I would never make it, cause I rap too fast  
I was desperately trying to find out, how to go from scraps to cash  
Remember, how y'all use to chase me home from school  
Just cause I sported corduroy britches, and Pro Wing shoes  
I use to have a lunch card, cause them times was hard  
Since the seven people living in one house, with no cars in the yard  
I remember stressing so hard, I couldn't keep my focus  
My only love was for extras, and overs  
Fuck all you niggaz, don't make me slap the fuck out all you niggaz  
If it ain't related to making paper, I ain't calling you niggaz  
I bet Mo City remember, when I took it over with rapping  
51-11 Ridgevan, moving that crack bitch I was stacking  
Residuals redeemingly, I was raw mayn raw caine  
Rapidly running my neighborhood, I was the law mayn  
'Member when I dropped my first album, in '98  
Fucking with Herman Fisher, but now that nigga hate me he's a cake  
Suppose to be mad at me, tal'n bout I owe him some change  
Nigga just mad cause they can't eat with me, I eat with Lil' James  
Rap-A-Lot Mafia my man, y'all remember the Maab  
This isn't Den-Den and Z-Ro, y'all better remember the squad  
Two different labels but the same cable, remember we connected  
Woodfair to Missouri City, two block of Screwed Up Texas  
  
[Hook: x2]  
Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes  
They use to rank on my low budget clothes, and my glasses  
Remember me, the same one they use to call egghead  
Now I play with fed bread, and sleep on Gucci bed spreads  
  
[P.O.P.:]  
I remember the winters in the hood, no heat cold nights  
No gas no lights, a ghetto low life  
So my flow twice as strong, from the memories  
I remember when my closest homies, turned to enemies  
See niggaz tend to be, down when your bread up  
But when you in the quicksand, they frown cause your legs stuck  
Yeah I remember that, so you remember this  
Hard times be my fuel, so I ain't finna quit  
I vividly, R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R  
Craig up in the E-R, bloody getting CPR  
So before, the reaper come and turn me to a memory  
I endlessly spit the heat, for the people to remember me  
Me P.O.P., so many forgot bout  
But not I, this for those who remember little Popeye  
And I remember hot guys, ridiculed the flow  
Now I'm front and center nigga, haters finna do me so

[Bun B:]  
Shit I remember back in the game, it was tough  
No matter what a nigga had, it was never enough  
See if I had five I wanted ten, and if I had ten I wanted twenty  
Fuck having some, shit I wanted plenty  
Back in the gap, when I first hit the block  
With my first 25, and a hand full of rocks  
Posted up at Samantha house on the West, on the porch  
Ready to give my nigga some work, or give him the torch  
I remember telling my T, I wasn't going to college  
And was headed to the streets, to get the rest of my knowledge  
That broke her heart, and for that I had to go  
So I went from the sidelines, to starring in the show  
Everything came slow, and nothing came fast  
Most times I was out of luck, and dead on my ass  
But with the heart of a hustler, and the mind of a G  
I came up, now I'm something to see Bun B
